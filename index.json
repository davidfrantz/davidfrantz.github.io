Remote sensing products are grouped in a hierarchical classification scheme. Level 0 data are the measurements taken onboard the satellite - they are not available to users. Level 1 data are radiometrically calibrated and georectified. Level 2 data most notably include some sort of atmospheric correction and probably other corrections like topographic correction. Level 3 data are temporal Level 2 aggregates, e.g. pixel based composites or statistical aggregations like multitemporal averages. Level 4 products are model output (classifications etc.), often derived from multi-temporal or multi-sensor measurements. I am defining Levels 1 and 2 as lower-level products and Levels 3 and above as higher-level products.\nWhat are Analysis Ready Data?  Analysis Ready Data are satellite data that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort and interoperability both through time and with other datasets (CEOS).\n Simply put, ARD are readily usable for any application without much further processing. In my opinion, such data need to be well corrected for atmospheric and other effects, have undergone a very good and aggressive cloud screening, are accompanied by pixel-based quality indicators (cloud masks but also other criteria), and are provided in a regular non-overlapping grid system without any redundancy in a single coordinate system (at least on the continental scale) in the form of data cubes.\nJust as a note: Although ARD are a huge step forward for increasing scientific and operational uptake from broader user groups, ARD do not represent the ultimate state of Analysis-Readiness. Thus, FORCE additionally provides means to generate highly Analysis Ready Data (hARD) and even highly Analysis Ready Data plus (hARD+), of which the latter can be directly ingested, analyzed, and interpreted in a GIS without ANY further processing. However, the scope of this tutorial is on plain ARD (don't get me wrong, ARD are great!).\nFORCE Level 2 Processing System The FORCE Level 2 Processing System is capable of generating such ARD.\nIn principle, the same algorithm is applied to all supported sensors, although specific processing options are triggered or are only available for some sensors. Essentially, L2PS converts each Level 1 image to ARD specification. This includes three main processing steps:\n cloud and cloud shadow detection radiometric correction data cubing  For Sentinel-2, two additional options are implemented:\n resolution merging, i.e. increase the spatial resolution of the 20m bands to 10m co-registration with Landsat time series  Note that most options and corrections can be switched off (e.g. atmospheric correction or data cubing) - this tutorial will however focus on our default parameterization for generating ARD.\n   FORCE Level 2 Processing System Workflow   Getting started This tutorial walks you through the main parts, for more details, please refer to the documentation.\nMake sure to have enough horsepower Generating ARD is compute-heavy. Input and output need quite some disc space. And processes need sufficient RAM. Please do not expect this to work on a weak laptop or similar. It is mainly intended to run on sufficiently powerful servers or virtual machines. There are some ways to make most out of rigs where RAM is an issue (see parallel processing section below), but there is a limit. At least, you will need to have 8-8.5GB of RAM for processing a Sentinel-2 image.\nRecommended folder structure Although not strictly required, I strongly suggest to use separate directories for Level 1 input data, Level 2 output data, parametrization, log files, temporary directory (if input are zip/tar.gz containers) and any other auxiliary data. So, let’s start by creating some directories, e.g.\nmkdir /data/force/level1 mkdir /data/force/level2 mkdir /data/force/param mkdir /data/force/log mkdir /data/force/misc mkdir /data/force/temp  The parameter file The core element of L2PS is the parameter file. An empty Level 2 parameter file can be generated with\nforce-parameter /data/force/param LEVEL2 1  LEVEL2 An empty parameter file skeleton was written to /data/force/param/LEVEL2-skeleton.prm Note that all parameters need to be given, even though some may not be used with you specific parameterization. You should rename the file, e.g. my-first-LEVEL2.prm. Parameterize according to your needs and run with force-level2 /data/force/param/my-first-LEVEL2.prm or for a single image: force-l2ps image /data/force/param/my-first-LEVEL2.prm  The trailing 1 means that descriptions for every parameter will be included. If you prefer a shorter parameter file, give a 0 instead. The descriptions can also be found in the documentation.\nLet’s rename the file, and have a look:\nmv /data/force/param/LEVEL2-skeleton.prm /data/force/param/l2ps.prm head /data/force/param/l2ps.prm  ++PARAM_LEVEL2_START++ # INPUT/OUTPUT DIRECTORIES # ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # The file queue specifies, which images are to be processed. The full path # to the file needs to be given. Do not paste the content of the file queue # into the parameter file. The file queue is mandatory for force-level2, but # may be NULL for force-l2ps. # Type: full file path FILE_QUEUE = NULL  It is a simple text file. Lines beginning with # are comments. All parameters are given in tag and value notation (TAG = VALUE). The file can be edited with any text editor. However, make sure that you are using Unix End-of-Line \\n. MOST errors are because of parameter files with Windows End-of-Line \\r\\n.\nParameterization Let's start to parameterize L2PS. Open the file in the text editor of your choice, e.g.\nvi /data/force/param/l2ps.prm  1) Input / Output The main input is a file queue that holds the full filepaths to all ingested images. All images that are enqueued (processing flag is QUEUED) will be processed, all other are ignored. After processing, the flag will be set to DONE. The Sentinel-2 Level 1C tutorial explains how to use the FORCE Level 1 Archiving Suite (FORCE L1AS) to download, organize, and maintain a clean and consistent Sentinel-2 Level 1 data pool, as well as corresponding data queues needed for the Level 2 processing. There isn't a tutorial for Landsat yet, but it works similarly. Let's assume, we already have downloaded some images, the file queue is set like this:\nFILE_QUEUE = /data/force/level1/queue.txt  Next, we set the directories for output, logfiles and temporary data. The temp directory is mostly used for temporarily unpacking zip/tar.gz containers.\nDIR_LEVEL2 = /data/force/level2 DIR_LOG = /data/force/log DIR_TEMP = /data/force/temp  2) Digital Elevation Model A Digital Elevation model is used to improve cloud and cloud shadow detection, atmospheric correction and to perform the topographic correction. The DEM tutorial explains how to properly prepare a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Let's assume, we already have prepared the DEM, it is set like this. Make sure to set the nodata value correctly:\nFILE_DEM = /data/force/misc/dem/srtm.vrt DEM_NODATA = -32767  3) Datacube parameters The datacube parameters, e.g. resolution, projection, tile size, block size, grid origin etc. are under full user control. As data cubing is an essential concept of FORCE, I highly recommend to read the Datacube tutorial, which explains what a datacube is, how it is parameterized, how you can find a POI, how to visualize the tiling grid, and how to conveniently display cubed data.\nOur parameter file already has some working defaults. You likely want to adjust them to your needs, but for starters, let's take the default values.\n4) Radiometric correction The default parameter file already has all radiometric corrections enabled, and this is the setup I commonly use for generating ARD. This includes atmospheric correction with multiple scattering effects, image-based AOD estimation, topographic correction, adjacency effect correction, and nadir BRDF correction. The only thing that needs to be changed (and only if processing Landsat data) is the parameterization of the water vapor correction. Please see the Water Vapor Database tutorial for instructions on how to prepare/download the Water Vapor Database. The directory that contains this database needs to be like this:\nDIR_WVPLUT = /data/force/misc/wvdb  5) Cloud detection The default parameter file already has meaningful values for the cloud correction. I usually don't tweak the Fmask parameters. You can probably change the maximum cloud cover parameters to your liking. The MAX_CLOUD_COVER_FRAME parameter cancels the processing of images that exceed the given threshold. The processing will be canceled right after cloud detection and thus saves quite some processing time. In my opinion, heavily clouded images are most often of little use, and even if cloud detection flags some pixels as \u0026ldquo;clear\u0026rdquo;, they are usually somewhat contaminated, e.g. diffuse transitions from clear to cloud or even false negatives.. Therefore, I commonly do not go up to 100%. The MAX_CLOUD_COVER_TILE parameter is similar, but it works on a per tile basis. It suppresses the output for chips (tiled image) that exceed the given threshold.\n6) Resolution merge This parameter defines the method used for improving the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2’s 20m bands to 10m. It defaults to the ImproPhe code, which is a data fusion option with both decent performance and quality. Let's keep this method, but feel free to try the other options.\n7) Co-Registration Since v. 3.0, FORCE is able to perform a co-registration of Sentinel-2 images with Landsat time series. For starters, we will not use this option. A separate tutorial is planned asap that will explain how to do this.\n8) Parallel Processing FORCE L2PS uses a nested parallelization strategy. The main parallelization level is multiprocessing: individual images are processed simultaneously (the box in the workflow figure). Each process can additionally use multithreading, which means that each image can be additionally processed parallely. The multiplication of both shouldn't exceed the number of threads your system supports.\nI recommend to use as many processes, and as few threads as possible. However, a mild mix may be beneficial, e.g. 2 threads per process. If processing only a few (or one) image, increase the multithreading ratio accordingly. This can speed up the work significantly. If RAM is too small, inncrease the multithreading ratio accordingly. If there isn't enough RAM to support all processes, some images will fail due to insufficient memory.\nTo prevent an I/O jam at startup (by reading / extracting a lot of data simultaneously), a delay (in seconds) might be necessary: a new process waits for some seconds before starting. The necessary delay (or none) is dependent on your system’s architecture (I/O speed etc), on sensor to be processed, and whether packed archives or uncompressed images are given as input.\nPlease note that I cannot recommend useful default settings. This is extremely dependent on your rig's setup (# of CPUs, RAM, I/O speed, parallel disc access etc.) and on what exactly you are doing (e.g. Sentinel-2 has higher ressource requirements compared to Landsat, are the input images extracted or still packed in zip/tar.gz containers, enabling/disabling certain processing options have an effect, too).\nPlease Have a look at these two setups (click to enlarge). The plots illustrate how the work (of processing the same 8 images) is being spread to CPUs and threads, how the delay works, and how the processes consume RAM (highly idealized - actually, the memory footprint varies across runtime).\n   Good setup Bad setup     4 processes with 2 threads each 8 processes with 1 thread each   RAM is large enough to support this many processes RAM is not large enough to support this many processes                In my case, I am running on a bare-metal Ubuntu server with 32 CPUs / 64 threads, 500GB RAM (way more than sufficient), and a RAID6 HDD file system that is directly attached to the server. Both my Landsat and Sentinel-2 input images are still packed. I am using these parameters:\nNPROC = 32 NTHREAD = 2 DELAY = 5  9) Output options The default output options are already my usual setup for ARD generation. The output files will be stored as compressed GeoTiff images with internal blocks for partial access. Note that metadata are written to the FORCE domain, thus they only show up if you look into all metadata domains, e.g.\nThe Bottom-of-Atmosphere reflectance product and the Quality Assurance Information are written by default - and they can't be disabled. I typically generate additional quicklooks (OUTPUT_OVV). If you want to generate pixel based composites in the next step, you should additionally output the OUTPUT_DST, OUTPUT_VZN, and OUTPUT_HOT products. The OUTPUT_AOD and OUTPUT_WVP products are not used by any higher level submodule - they are only useful for validation purposes.\nProcessing Once the parameter file is finished, processing is pretty straight forward. Simply feed the parameter file to force-level2. A progress bar keeps you updated about the ETA, the number of completed, running and waiting processes.\nforce-level2 /data/force/param/l2ps.prm  47 images enqueued. Start processing with 32 CPUs Computers / CPU cores / Max jobs to run 1:local / 64 / 32 Computer:jobs running/jobs completed/%of started jobs/Average seconds to complete ETA: 12046s Left: 45 AVG: 280.00s local:32/2/100%/596.5s  Logfile After processing, I recommend to check the logfiles, which we have written to /data/force/log\nls /data/force/log | tail  S2A_OPER_MSI_L1C_TL_SGS__20160310T160000_A003736_T33JYG_N02.01 S2A_OPER_MSI_L1C_TL_SGS__20160409T141153_A004165_T33JYG_N02.01 S2A_OPER_MSI_L1C_TL_SGS__20160827T135818_A006167_T33JYG_N02.04 S2A_OPER_MSI_L1C_TL_SGS__20160916T135429_A006453_T33JYG_N02.04  The logfiles report the percentage of data cover (how many pixels are not no-data), water cover, snow cover and cloud cover. Then, aerosol optical depth @ 550 nm (scene average), and the number of dark targets for retrieving aerosol optical depth (over water/vegetation) are printed. Then, the number of products written (number of tiles), and a supportive success indication is printed. In the case the overall cloud coverage is higher than allowed, the image is skipped.

Processing time: 12 mins 17 secs  Output format For all details on the output format, please refer to the documentation.\nThe output data are organized in data cubes. The tiles manifest as directories in the file system, and the images are stored within. This is decribed in more detail in the Datacube tutorial.\nBasically, for each tile, you get a time series of square image chips that always show the same extent:\n   Data Cube of Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 A/B Level 2 ARD. A two-month period of atmospherically corrected imagery acquired over South-East Berlin, Germany, is shown here.   Each dataset consists of a BOA and QAI product, which are Bottom-of-Atmosphere reflectance and Quality Assurance Information. Depending on parameterization ,there are more products, e.g. OVV for image overviews (quicklooks).\nThe reflectance products are multi-band images and consist of 6 bands for Landsat (Landsat legacy bands), and 10 bands for Sentinel-2 (land surface bands). All bands are provided at the same spatial resolution, typically 30m for Landsat and 10m for Sentinel-2.\nQAI are provided bit-wise for each pixel. QAI are essential for making your analyses a success, therefore, please have a look at the Quality Bits tutorial.\nMetadata are written to all output products. Note that FORCE-specific metadata will be written to the FORCE domain, and thus are probably not visible unless the FORCE domain (or all domains) are specifically requested:\ngdalinfo -mdd all /data/force/level2/X0007_Y0007/20170424_LEVEL2_SEN2A_BOA.tif  Driver: GTiff/GeoTIFF Files: /data/force/level2/X0007_Y0007/20170424_LEVEL2_SEN2A_BOA.tif Size is 3000, 3000 Coordinate System is: PROJCS[\u0026quot;WGS 84 / UTM zone 33S\u0026quot;, GEOGCS[\u0026quot;WGS 84\u0026quot;, DATUM[\u0026quot;WGS_1984\u0026quot;, ...

FORCE provides a lot of functionality to further process the generated ARD into hARD or hARD+ products, e.g. using pixel-based compositing or time series analyses.\nPlease see the Higher Level processing options in the documentation.

Operational coregistration of Sentinel-2A and -2B imagery is thus required. We present a modification of the established Landsat Sentinel Registration (LSReg) algorithm. The modifications enabled LSReg to be included in an operational preprocessing workflow to automatically coregister large volumes of Sentinel-2 imagery with Landsat base images that represent multiannual monthly spectral average values. The modified LSReg was tested for the complete Sentinel-2 archive covering Crete, Greece, which is a particularly challenging region due to steep topographic gradients and high shares of water in Sentinel-2 tiles. A coregistration success rate of 87.5% of all images was obtained with a mean coregistration precision of 4.4 m. The mean shifts of 14.0 m in the x-direction and 13.4 m in the y-direction before coregistration were found, with maxima exceeding four pixels. Time series noise in locations with land cover transitions (n = 585) was effectively reduced by 43% using the presented approach. The multitemporal geometric consistency of the Sentinel-2 data set was substantially improved, thus enabling time series analyses within the Sentinel-2 data record, as well as integrated Landsat and Sentinel-2A and -2B data sets.

Using data provided by different sensors can greatly improve the temporal resolution of time series, fill data gaps and thus improve the quality of land cover monitoring applications. However, multi-sensor approaches are often adversely affected by different spectral characteristics of the sensing instruments, leading to inconsistencies in downstream products. Spectral harmonization, i.e., the transformation of one sensor into the spectral domain of another sensor, may reduce these inconsistencies. It simplifies workflows, increases the reliability of subsequently derived multi-sensor products and may also enable the generation of new products that are not possible with the initial spectral definition. In this paper, we compare the effect of multivariate spectral harmonization techniques on the inter-sensor reflectance consistency and derived products such as spectral indices or land cover classifications. We simulated surface reflectance data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A from airborne hyperspectral data to eliminate any sources of error originating from unequal acquisition geometries, illumination or atmospheric state. We evaluate different methods based on linear, quadratic and random forest regression as well as linear interpolation, and predict not only matching but also unilaterally missing bands (red edge). We additionally consider material-dependent spectral characteristics in the harmonization process by using separate transformation functions for spectral clusters of the input dataset. Our results suggest that spectral harmonization is useful to improve multi-sensor consistency of remote sensing data and subsequently derived products, especially if multiple transformation functions are incorporated. There is a strong dependency between harmonization performance and the similarity of source and target sensor's spectral characteristics. For spectrally transforming Landsat-8 to Sentinel-2A, we achieved the lowest radiometric inter-sensor deviations with 50 spectral clusters and linear regression. Based on simulated data, deviations are below 1.7% reflectance within the red edge spectral region and below 0.3% reflectance for the remaining bands (RMSE). Regarding spectral indices, our results show a reduction of inter-sensor deviation (vegetation pixels only) to 38% of the initial error for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and to 43% for EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). Furthermore, we computed the REIP (Red Edge Inflection Point) with an accuracy of 3.1 nm from Sentinel-2 adapted Landsat-8 data. An exemplary multispectral classification use case revealed an increasing inter-sensor consistency of classification results from 92.3% to 97.3% mean error. Applied to time series of real Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data, we observed similar trends, albeit intermingled with non-sensor-induced inconsistencies.","tags":null,"title":"Spectral harmonization and red edge prediction of Landsat-8 to Sentinel-2 using land cover optimized multivariate regressors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marcel Schwieder, David Frantz, David Loibl, Kira Pfoch, Patrick Hostert\nWissenschaftlich-Technische Jahrestagung der DGPF, 4-6 March 2020, Stuttgart, Germany  oral presentation\n","date":1583280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583280000,"objectID":"dad9d82d780975af26d3e5a3f5dbc63f","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/schwieder-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/schwieder-2020/","section":"presentation","summary":"Marcel Schwieder, David Frantz, David Loibl, Kira Pfoch, Patrick Hostert @ 40.

In the FORCE Higher Level Processing System, processing masks can be used to restrict processing and analysis to certain pixels of interest. The masks need to be in datacube format, i.e. they need to be raster images in the same grid as all the other data. The masks can - but don’t need to - be in the same directory as the other data. The masks should be binary images. The pixels that have a mask value of 0 will be skipped.\nWhat is the advantage of using processing masks?   Processing masks speed up processing.\n For each processing unit (block within the tile), the analysis mask is read first. If no valid pixel is in there, all the other data are not input, and the block is skipped. As an example, when processing a country like Japan, and provide a land mask, you can speed up processing significantly as many blocks are skipped entirely. On the pixel level, invalid pixels are skipped, too. This is especially beneficial for CPU-heavy tasks, e.g. machine learning predictions. As an example, when computing a tree species classification, you can speed up processing substantially if you provide a forest masks.    Processing masks decrease data volume substantially.\n In the processed products, the pixels of no interest have a nodata value. As all FORCE output is compressed (unless you choose to output in ENVI format; I don’t recommend to do this), the compression kicks in nicely if you have used processing masks. You can easily decrease data volume by several factors.    Processing masks facilitate analyzing the processed data.\n In the processed products, the pixels of no interest have a nodata value. Thus, you don’t need to sort the pixels on your own, e.g. computing confusion matrices and classification accuracy is more straightforward to implement.    Generate processing masks Option 1: from shapefile to mask FORCE comes with a program to generate processing masks from a shapefile:\nforce-cube  Usage: force-cube input-file output-dir resample resolution input-file: the file you want to cube output-dir: the directory you want to store the cubes; datacube-definition.prj needs to exist in there resample: resampling method (1) any GDAL resampling method for raster data, e.g. cubic (2) rasterize for vector data resolution: the resolution of the cubed data  force-cube imports raster or vector data into the datacube format needed by FORCE. The output directory needs to contain a copy of the datacube definition (see datacube tutorial).\nThe rasterize resampling option rasterizes polygon vector geometries. It burns the occurence of the geometry into a raster image, i.e. it assigns the value 1 to all cells that are covered by a geometry, 0 if not. The resulting masks are compressed GeoTiff images. Do not worry about data volume when converting from vector to raster data, because the compression rate is extremely high.\nIn the following example, we generate a processing mask for the administrative area of Vienna, Austria.\nforce-cube vienna.shp /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask rasterize 10  0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done. 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done. 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done. 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.  In this example, Vienna is covered by four tiles, a cubed GeoTiff was generated in each tile:\nls /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask/X*/vienna.tif  /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask/X0077_Y0058/vienna.tif /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask/X0077_Y0059/vienna.tif /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask/X0078_Y0058/vienna.tif /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask/X0078_Y0059/vienna.tif  For speedy visuailzation, build overviews and pyramids:\nforce-mosaic /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask force-pyramid /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask/mosaic/vienna.vrt  mosaicking vienna.tif 4 chips found. computing pyramids for vienna.vrt 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.     Mask of Vienna generated from a shapefile. Overlayed with the processing grid in green   Option 2: from raster to mask As of now, FORCE does not come with a handy tool to generate masks from a raster image with continuous values (this is on my to-do list though). However, you can follow this recipe to accomplish this.\nIn the example given below, our input image is a multiband continuous fields dataset, which gives the percentages of built-up land (urban), high vegetation (trees), and low vegetation (grass, agriculture). Point 1) may be skipped if the data are already in datacube format, which is the case in this example.\n If the data are not already in the datacube format, use force-cube to import the data (see the usage above). Use a raster resampling option to trigger the raster import, e.g. cubic (bc it's all about cubes, eh?). Go to the parent directory of the cubed images (this is important for the next point), and generate a list with the filenames:  cd /data/Jakku/germany-LC/pred ls X*/CONFIELD_MLP.tif \u0026gt; files.txt  In this example, the image covers 597 tiles:  wc -l files.txt  597 files.txt  head files.txt  X0052_Y0045/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0052_Y0046/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0052_Y0047/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0052_Y0048/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0052_Y0049/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0052_Y0050/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0052_Y0051/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0052_Y0052/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0052_Y0053/CONFIELD_MLP.tif X0053_Y0045/CONFIELD_MLP.tif  Generate the masks using a command similar to the example below. The 1st part of the command uses the list from point 2), and parallely calls the command in parentheses \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;. The curly braces {//} replace the input image with its dirname, i.e. with the tile ID. A directory for the tile is generated if it is not already existing. The gdal_calc.py command handles simple raster algebra. The -A and --A_band options specify the image and band on which to operate the calculation specified by --calc (in our input image, the tree percentage is in band 2). A binary image (= mask) will be generated, wherein all pixels larger than 3000 (i.e. 30%) are set to 1. The --creation-option parameters are options that specify compression etc. The blocksize parameters should best reflect the blocksize used for the datacube (see datacube tutorial). As said before, a tool for this will likely be implemented in a not-so-far future version of FORCE.  parallel -a files.txt \u0026quot;mkdir -p /data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask/{//}; gdal_calc.py -A {} --A_band=2 --outfile=/data/Dagobah/edc/misc/mask/{//}/forest-mask.tif --calc='(A\u0026gt;3000)' --NoDataValue=255 --type=Byte --format=GTiff --creation-option='COMPRESS=LZW' --creation-option='PREDICTOR=2' --creation-option='NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS' --creation-option='BIGTIFF=YES' --creation-option='BLOCKXSIZE=3000' --creation-option='BLOCKYSIZE=300'\u0026quot;  0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done 0 .. 10 .. 20 .. 30 .. 40 .. 50 .. 60 .. 70 .. 80 .. 90 .. 100 - Done ...

Based on some user-defined parameters (coordinates etc.) FORCE L1AS pulls a metadata report from the Copernicus API Hub. Each hit is compared with the local data holdings you already downloaded. If a new file is sitting on ESA's end, the missing image is downloaded. A file queue is generated and updated accordingly - which is the main input to the FORCE Level 2 Processing System.\n   Sentinel-2 downloader in the FORCE Level 1 Archiving Suite   Setup Now, the first step is to get access to ESA's data and services. For that, you need an account. If you don't have one, register here. It's free.\nThen, your credentials must be made available to FORCE L1AS to be able to request and receive ESA data. On your machine, your login credentials must be placed in a hidden file .scihub in your home directory. I advise to only give user reading rights to this file. The user name goes in the first line, the password in the second line. Please note that special characters might be problematic. Also note, if you generate this file from a Windows machine, the Windows EOL character will cause problems.\nDownload some data Instructions After setting up your account, you should be able to download Sentinel-2 data via FORCE L1AS. As with any other FORCE program, you can display short usage instructions by executing the program without any parameters.\nforce-level1-sentinel2  Usage: force-level1-sentinel2 Level-1-Datapool queue Boundingbox starttime endtime min-cc max-cc [dry] Level-1-Datapool An existing directory, your files will be stored here queue Downloaded files are appended to a file queue, which is needed for the Level 2 processing.

If you don't dare to download all data straight away, there is a dry run option implemented that only checks how much data would be downloaded with the parameters you provided. This is given by the optional dry keyword at the end of the command line. The following query asks for all data in July 2019 with a maximum cloud coverage of 50%. The region of interest here is a rather small area in Zambia's Northwestern Province, depicting a large copper mine in the Miombo forest.\nThe single most frequent error here is the specification of the coordinates.

For example, a daily cronjob can be installed to retrieve all data covering your study area. A cronjob is installed by adding lines to the cronjob file.\ncrontab -e  If your FORCE installation is not in a standard search path, you need to define the PATH variable, and include the path where FORCE is installed. Then, use the command line from above and schedule it with cron notation. Following line will start the download at 3:00 AM each day.

For details, see here. As of now (the following numbers might change in the future), the last year of data shall stay online, and is immediately ready for download. Offline data may be pulled from offline to online storage upon request. The data retrieval shall happen within 24h and the products shall stay online for 3 days. If they were not downloaded within this time period, they need to be pulled again. A user quota is implemented to prevent users from pulling the entire archive - unfortunately this quota is ridicously low, 1 request per hour per user\u0026hellip; Let's all hope it doesn't stay this way :/\nFORCE \u0026gt;= 3.0 is able to handle LTA data. Previous FORCE versions crash when trying to download offline products. FORCE L1AS determines whether a product is online or offline.\n If online, the image is downloaded as described above. If offline, a pull request from offline to online storage is sent. ESA hasn't implemented any callback for this retrieval, thus FORCE L1AS will simply send pull requests for each requested offline image, probably download some available online images, and then exit. FORCE L1AS needs to be run again to retrieve the restored data. To this end, it comes in handy to set up a download scheduler as desribed above.  force-level1-sentinel2 /data/Dagobah/S2L1C /data/Dagobah/S2L1C/zambia.txt \u0026quot;25.43/-12.46,25.94/-12.46,25.94/-11.98,25.39/-11.99,25.43/-12.46\u0026quot; 2018-07-01 2018-07-31 0 50  2020-02-15_15:49:18 - Found 12 S2A/B files. 2020-02-15_15:49:18 - Found 12 S2A/B files on this page.

In the cloud shadow detection, the DEM is primarily used to distinguish cloud shadows from water and topographic shadows. In the atmospheric correction, the DEM is used to scale the optical depths with altitude. The topographic correction is of course relying on the DEM. In principle, FORCE L2PS can be used without a DEM (FILE_DEM = NULL). In this case, the surface is assumed to be flat at z = 0m a.s.l. The topographic correction, however, can only be used if a DEM is given (surprise).\nIn any case, it is strongly advised to use a DEM. Plus, it is not complicated to acquire it, free options are available. You probably already have a DEM for your study area anyway.\nData format There are little requirements on the data format:\n The unit must be meters. The Nodata value shouldn't be 0, which is a valid elevation. The DEM must cover the complete image(s) to be processed.  Thus, a mosaic that covers your complete study area needs to be prepared. The DEM is warped and cropped to the projection and extent of the Level 1 image, which is processed with FORCE L2PS. This is done on-the-fly. Therefore, data type, data format, projection, extent etc. can be chosen freely - as long as GDAL is able to handle it (GDAL can handle pretty much anything).\nPlease note, that pixels with nodata values in the DEM will have nodata values in the Level 2 products, too. Thus, make sure your DEM covers the complete area of interest.\nWhich DEM? The DEM should match the resolution of the Level 1 image data as closely as possible. If possible, it is advised to use a finer resolution. However, as it is hard to acquire high spatial resolution DEMs, especially for larger areas, lower resolution works too. Often, we use the 30m SRTM DEM or 30m ASTER DEM, or a combination thereof, e.g. SRTM filled with ASTER (SRTM is a bit better, but there are holes in mountainous regions, and coverage is only 60°N-60°S).\nThe SRTM DEM can be obtained from EarthExplorer. The ASTER DEM can be obtained from EarthData or Japan Space Systems. Both are free of charge.\nPrepare the mosaic The following steps illustrate how to build a virtual mosaic from SRTM data. Generally, DEM data come in tiles (datacube style), e.g. each SRTM tile covers 1°. The GDAL Virtual Format allows to mosaick data without producing a physical representation, i.e. the virtual mosaic only holds links to the original tiled data, plus some rules on how to combine them into the mosaic.\nAssuming you have downloaded some SRTM tiles, we first prepare a text file that holds all the filepaths:\nfind /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm -name '*.tif' \u0026gt; /data/Earth/global/dem/srtm.txt cat /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm.txt  /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n35_e027_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n35_e026_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n37_e026_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n36_e025_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n37_e027_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n37_e025_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n36_e024_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n35_e023_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n37_e024_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n36_e026_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n37_e023_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n35_e024_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n35_e025_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n36_e023_1arc_v3.tif /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm/n36_e027_1arc_v3.tif  Then, we use the gdalbuildvrt command to generate the virtual mosaic.\ngdalbuildvrt -input_file_list /data/Dagobah/global/dem/srtm.txt /data/Earth/global/dem/srtm.vrt  0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.

This includes two main points:\n All data are in the same coordinate system, which should be valid for a large regional extent (e.g. a continental projection). The data are organized in regular, non-overlapping tiles.     Overview of the datacube concept in FORCE     The ‘grid’ is the regular spatial subdivision of the land surface in the target coordinate system. The ‘grid origin’ is the location, where the tile numbering starts with zero. Tile numbers increase toward the South and East. Although not recommended, negative tile numbers may be present if the tile origin is not North–West of the study area. The ‘tile’ is one entity of the grid, i.e., a grid cell with a unique tile identifier, e.g., X0003_Y0002. The tile is stationary, i.e., it always covers the same extent on the land surface. The ‘tile size’ is defined in target coordinate system units (most commonly in meters). Tiles are square. Each ‘original image’ is partitioned into several ‘chips’, i.e., any original image is intersected with the grid and then tiled into chips. Chips are grouped in ‘datasets’, which group data, e.g. according to acquisition date and sensor. The ‘data cube’ groups all datasets within a tile in a time-ordered manner. The data cube may contain data from several sensors and different resolutions. Thus, the pixel size is allowed to vary, but the tile extent stays fixed. The tile size must be a multiple of the resolutions. Other data like features or auxiliary data are also permitted in the data cube (e.g. DEM or climate variables). The data cube concept allows for non-redundant data storage and efficient data access, as well as simplified extraction of data and information.   How to define the datacube parameters? When generating Level 2 ARD data with FORCE L2PS, you need to define the datacube in the parameter file. Empty parameter files can be generated with force-parameter.\n DO_REPROJ indicates whether the images should be reprojected to the target coordinate system - or stay in their original UTM projection. DO_TILE indicates whether the images should be tiled to chips that intersect with the grid system - or stay in the original reference system (WRS-2/MGRS). PROJECTION defines the target coordinate system. This projection should ideally be valid for a large geographic extent. The projection needs to given as \u0026ldquo;WKT\u0026rdquo; string. You can verify your projection (and convert to WKT from another format) using gdalsrsinfo (see below). If this fails, you need to fix the projection - otherwise FORCE L2PS will likely fail, too. ORIGIN_LAT and ORIGIN_LON are the origin coordinates of the grid system in decimal degree. The upper left corner of tile X0000_Y0000 represents this point. It is a good choice to use a coordinate that is North-West of your study area – to avoid negative tile numbers. TILE_SIZE is the tile size (in target units, commonly in meters). Tiles are square. BLOCK_SIZE is the block size (in target units, commonly in meters) of the image chips. Blocks are stripes, i.e. they are as wide as the tile and as high as specified here. The blocks represent the internal structure of the GeoTiffs, and represent the primary processing unit of the force-higher-level routines.  Two default projection / grid systems are predefined in FORCE. They can be specified via the PROJECTION parameter instead of giving a WKT string. The predefined options have their own settings for ORIGIN_LAT, ORIGIN_LON, TILE_SIZE, and BLOCK_SIZE, thus the values given in the parameterfile will be ignored. EQUI7 consists of 7 Equi-Distant, continental projections with a tile size of 100km. GLANCE7 consists of 7 Equal-Area, continental projections, with a tile size of 150km. One datacube will be generated for each continent.\nIf you are not using the datacube options, i.e. DO_REPROJ = FALSE or DO_TILE = FALSE, you are running into a dead end for FORCE. In this case, the data cannot be further processed or analysed with any higher level FORCE functionality\u0026hellip;\nHow to validate the projection?

There are many, many tiles. How do I find a POI? Given any coordinate \\((\\lambda,\\phi)\\), the computation of the corresponding tile is pretty straightforward.\n Convert the coordinate \\((\\lambda,\\phi)\\) to the projected coordinate \\((X,Y)\\) Given the tile size \\(t_s\\) and the grid origin in projected coordinates \\((X_O,Y_O)\\), the tile ID can be computed as \\(Tile_X = floor((X-X_O)/t_s)\\) and \\(Tile_Y = floor((Y_O-Y)/t_s)\\)  With some more math, you can also compute the exact pixel.\nHowever, there is also a FORCE program that relieves you from doing this on your own:\nforce-tile-finder  usage: force-tile-finder datacube lon lat res  force-tile-finder /data/Dagobah/edc/level2 13.404194 52.502889 10  Point { LON/LAT (13.40,52.50) | X/Y (4552071.50,3271363.25) } is in tile X0069_Y0043 at pixel 2604/1355  Another useful FORCE program can generate a vector file (shapefile or kml) for convenient display of the tiles.\nforce-tabulate-grid  usage: force-tabulate-grid datacube bottom top left right format format: shp or kml  force-tabulate-grid /data/Dagobah/edc/level2 35 60 0 20 kml  /data/Dagobah/edc/level2/datacube-grid.kml  The grid can easily be loaded in GoogleEarth or any GIS. The attribute table contains the tile ID.\n   Exported grid loaded in Google Earth   How to visualize data for a large extent more conveniently? Whenever you use a FORCE routine, cubed data will be generated. It is a bit cumbersome to display such data for a large extent without some further treatment. The following recipe can be used for any cubed FORCE data - irrespective of processing level.\nLucky us, the GDAL virtual format represents an ideal concept for this. With VRTs, mosaicks of cubed data can be generated without physically copying the data. The VRT is basically a text file in xml-Format, which both holds (relative) links to the original data and the rules to assemble the mosaic on-the-fly. FORCE comes with a tool to generate such mosaics:\nforce-mosaic  Usage: force-mosaic tiled-archive  force-mosaic /data/Dagobah/edc/level2  force-mosaic searches for image files in the datacube, and mosaics all files with the same basename. The mosaics are stored in the mosaic subdirectory.\nls /data/Dagobah/edc/level2/mosaic | head  19840328_LEVEL2_LND05_BOA.vrt 19840328_LEVEL2_LND05_CLD.vrt 19840328_LEVEL2_LND05_HOT.vrt 19840328_LEVEL2_LND05_QAI.vrt 19840328_LEVEL2_LND05_VZN.vrt 19840409_LEVEL2_LND05_BOA.vrt 19840409_LEVEL2_LND05_CLD.vrt 19840409_LEVEL2_LND05_HOT.vrt 19840409_LEVEL2_LND05_QAI.vrt 19840409_LEVEL2_LND05_VZN.vrt  To speed up visualization, pyramids might be generated for the VRT files. This significantly increases loading and response times for visualization.

Consider from case to case whether fast display merits the excess disc usage.

FORCE L2PS provides a description of the quality of each pixel in the form of quality bits. This bit-packed information allows users to apply per pixel filters to all Level 2 products. The bits represent combinations of surface, atmospheric, and processing-related conditions that can affect the overall usefulness of a given pixel for a particular application. The success of any follow-up analysis depends on the rigorous usage of these information! A good explanation of quality bits is given by the USGS:\n The bit-packed information in the QA bands is a translation of binary strings. For example, the integer value “1” translates to the binary value “0001.” The binary value “0001” has 4 bits, written right to left as bits 0 (“1”), 1 (“0”), 2 (“0”), and 3 (“0”). Each of the bits 0-3 represents a condition that can affect the calculation of a physical value. [\u0026hellip;] If the condition is true, the bit is set to “1,” or “0” if false.\n Sounds complicated… Why not use a scene classification? Although interpretation of quality bits is not immediate to humans, they do possess quite some advantages. As opposed to a scene classification, quality bits allow the flagging of multiple conditions, e.g. ice clouds, cloud shadows on top of clouds or snow, high aerosol load and cloud, etc. If a 16bit Integer is used for storing the quality bits, up to 16 different conditions can co-exist in any possible combination. In a scene classification, only one condition can be stored, and the algorithm developer needs to make assumptions on the priority of the conditions; however these may differ from application to application. Quality bits allow to store all these information in a single image. From a technical perspective, quality bits save disc space, and reduce the I/O load for follow-up analyses.\nQuality bits in FORCE In FORCE, the quality bits are found in the Quality Assurance Information (QAI) product, which is an integral part of each Level 2 dataset, and is alway present next to the reflectance images (BOA or TOA). When generating Best Available Pixel (BAP) composites (Level 3), the bit flags of the selected observation are stored in the first band of the composite information (INF) product. Currently FORCE implements a 16bit QAI layer with 12 quality bits, some of them as double-bit words:\n   Bit No. Parameter name Bit comb. Integer State     0 Valid data 0 0 valid     1 1 no data   1–2 Cloud state 00 0 clear     01 1 less confident cloud (i.e., buffered cloud 300 m)     10 2 confident, opaque cloud     11 3 cirrus   3 Cloud shadow flag 0 0 no     1 1 yes   4 Snow flag 0 0 no     1 1 yes   5 Water flag 0 0 no     1 1 yes   6–7 Aerosol state 00 0 estimated (best quality)     01 1 interpolated (mid quality)     10 2 high (aerosol optical depth \u0026gt; 0.6, use with caution)     11 3 fill (global fallback, low quality)   8 Subzero flag 0 0 no     1 1 yes (use with caution)   9 Saturation flag 0 0 no     1 1 yes (use with caution)   10 High sun zenith flag 0 0 no     1 1 yes (sun elevation \u0026lt; 15°, use with caution)   11–12 Illumination state 00 0 good (incidence angle \u0026lt; 55°, best quality for top. correction)     01 1 medium (incidence angle 55°–80°, good quality for top. correction)     10 2 poor (incidence angle \u0026gt; 80°, low quality for top. correction)     11 3 shadow (incidence angle \u0026gt; 90°, no top. correction applied)   13 Slope flag 0 0 no (cosine correction applied)     1 1 yes (enhanced C-correction applied)   14 Water vapor flag 0 0 measured (best quality, only Sentinel-2)     1 1 fill (scene average, only Sentinel-2)   15 Empty 0 0 TBD      Nodata values are values where nothing was observed, where auxiliary data was not given (e.g. nodata in DEM), or where data is substantially corrupt (e.g. impulse noise, or when the surface reflectance estimate is \u0026gt; 2.0 or \u0026lt; -1.0) Clouds are given in three categories, i.e. opaque clouds (confident cloud), buffered clouds (300m; less confident cloud), and cirrus clouds. Cloud shadows are detected on the basis of the cloud layer. If a cloud is missed, the cloud shadow is missed, too. If a false positive cloud is detected, false positive cloud shadows follow. Aerosol Optical Depth is estimated for fairly coarse grid cells. If there is no valid AOD estimation in any cell, values are interpolated. If there is no valid AOD estimation for the complete image, a fill value is assigned (AOD is guessed). If AOD @550nm is higher than 0.6, it is flagged as high aerosol; this is not necessarily critical, but should be used with caution (see subzero flag). If the surface reflectance estimate in any band is \u0026lt; 0, the subzero flag is set. This can point to overestimation of AOD. If DNs were saturated, or if the surface reflectance estimate in any band is \u0026gt; 1, the saturation flag is set. If sun elevation is smaller than 15°, the high sun zenith flag is set. Use this data with caution, radiative transfer computations might be out of specification. The illumination state is related to the quality of the topographic correction. If the incidence angle is smaller than 55°, quality is best. If the incidence angle is larger than 80°, the quality of the topographic correction is low, and data artefacts are possible. If the area is not illuminated at all, no topographic correction is done (values are the same as without topographic correction). The slope flag indicates whether a simple cosine correction (slope ≤ 2°) was used for topographic correction, or if the enhanced C-correction was used (slope \u0026gt; 2°). The water vapor flag indicates whether water vapor was estimated, or if the scene average was used to fill. Water vapor is not estimated over water and cloud shadow pixels. This flag only applies to Sentinel-2 images.   Visualization Visualizing the raw QAI image is pretty meaningless. Don’t be surprised that the integers do not resemble any of the patterns you would expect (e.g. cloud distribution).\n   Sentinel-2B image over Berlin, 01.07.2019; left: RGB image; right: quality bits   Quicklooks Since v. 3.0, FORCE L2PS can output quicklook images for each Level 2 dataset (OVV = overview product). These thumbnails serve as first impression of image quality. Some of the quality conditions are superimposed on the RGB images. Opaque clouds are shown in pink, cirrus clouds in red, cloud shadows in cyan, snow in yellow, saturated pixels in orange, and sub-zero reflectance values in a greenish tone. The overview for the QAI image from above is shown here:\n   Quicklook image generated by FORCE L2PS; pink: opaque clouds; cyan: cloud shadows   Inflate quality bits A full deciphering of all quality bits to individual quality masks can be generated with FORCE:\nforce-qai-inflate  Usage: force-qai-inflate QAI dir format  force-qai-inflate /data/level2/X0069_Y0043/20190701_LEVEL2_SEN2B_QAI.tif ~/temp GTiff  This program generates a 12-band image, where each of the flags (see table above) is written to a separate band. However, force-qai-inflate was not designed to generate inflated masks for each and every Level 2 product in a routine manner due to the computational and disc-space related overhead. We strongly recommend to make use of the bits directly (see remaining part of the tutorial).\n   Quality bits; left: cloud state; right: cloud shadow flag   Quality bit rendering in QGIS There is a nice QGIS plugin from my colleague Benjamin Jakimow, which can visualize quality bits in QGIS on the fly. Quality bit inflating is not necessary anymore! The Bit Flag Renderer plugin provides a new renderer for QGIS, with which any quality bit product can flexibly be visualized. The plugin includes predefined bit visualization rules for the FORCE QAI bits. The default visualization matches the information and colors from the quicklook images described above):\n   Bit Flag Renderer in QGIS displaying a quality bit layer on-the-fly with the pre-defined FORCE settings   Quality masking in Higher Level Processing For follow-up processing and analyses, the usage of the QAI information is key, e.g. to exclude clouds. In all FORCE Higher Level routines, quality masking is done on the fly, and the user has full control about what condition(s) to filter. The parameter SCREEN_QAI provides a simple mechanism to mask out any combination of conditions using any of the following keywords: NODATA, CLOUD_OPAQUE, CLOUD_BUFFER, CLOUD_CIRRUS, CLOUD_SHADOW, SNOW, WATER, AOD_FILL, AOD_HIGH, AOD_INT, SUBZERO, SATURATION, SUN_LOW, ILLUMIN_NONE, ILLUMIN_POOR, ILLUMIN_LOW, SLOPED, WVP_NONE. The default parametrization is to filter out nodata, clouds, cloud shadows, snow, saturated or subzero reflectance:\nSCREEN_QAI = NODATA CLOUD_OPAQUE CLOUD_BUFFER CLOUD_CIRRUS CLOUD_SHADOW SNOW SUBZERO SATURATION\nFollowing images illustrate the effect of quality filtering on an average reflectance image generated by using all available observations over a 3 month period (using Spectral Temporal Metrics in the Time Series Analysis module). The left image was produced by filtering nodata values only, the right image was produced using the default quality screening.\n   Average reflectance over three month; left: not using quality bits; right with quality bits   ","date":1580688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580688000,"objectID":"1055a50cff8da2ae80586d570fd44eab","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/tutorials/force-qai/qai/","publishdate":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutorials/force-qai/qai/","section":"tutorials","summary":"This tutorial will explain what quality bits are, how quality bits are implemented in FORCE, how to visualize them, and how to deal with them in Higher Level Processing.","tags":["2020","FORCE","Tutorial"],"title":"FORCE Tutorial: Quality Bits a.k.a.

This saves you a lot of processing. This freely available dataset was generated with the FORCE WVDB component, and is comprised of daily global water vapor data for February 2000 to July 2018 for each land-intersecting WRS-2 scene (13281 coordinates), as well as a monthly climatology that can be used if no daily value is available.\nGenerate the WVDB on your own We try to update this dataset in regular intervals.

The pre-compiled dataset includes such a table. If you are not interested in global coverage, you can subset this file. The file should contain two columns separated by white space, and no header. The first column should give the longitude (X), the second column the latitude (Y) with coordinates in decimal degree (negative values for West/South).

The freely available software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring) is capable of generating Landsat ARD. An essential step of generating ARD is atmospheric correction, which requires water vapor data. FORCE relies on a water vapor database obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, two major drawbacks arise from this strategy: (1) The database has to be compiled for each study area prior to generating ARD; and (2) MODIS and Landsat commissioning dates are not well aligned. We have therefore compiled an application-ready global water vapor database to significantly increase the operational readiness of ARD production. The free dataset comprises daily water vapor data for February 2000 to July 2018 as well as a monthly climatology that is used if no daily value is available. We systematically assessed the impact of using this climatology on surface reflectance outputs. A global random sample of Landsat 5/7/8 imagery was processed twice (i) using daily water vapor (reference) and (ii) using the climatology (estimate), followed by computing accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (APU) metrics. All APU measures were well below specification, thus the fallback usage of the climatology is generally a sound strategy. Still, the tests revealed that some considerations need to be taken into account to help quantify which sensor, band, climate, and season are most or least affected by using a fallback climatology. The highest uncertainty and bias is found for Landsat 5, with progressive improvements towards newer sensors. The bias increases from dry to humid climates, whereas uncertainty increases from dry and tropic to temperate climates. Uncertainty is smallest during seasons with low variability, and is highest when atmospheric conditions progress from a dry to a wet season (and vice versa).","tags":null,"title":"A Global MODIS Water Vapor Database for the Operational Atmospheric Correction of Historic and Recent Landsat Imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"72fdb55c0ec41767126ca36431a4729b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2019a/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.339432Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2019a/","section":"publication","summary":"Ever increasing data volumes of satellite constellations call for multi-sensor analysis ready data (ARD) that relieve users from the burden of all costly preprocessing steps. This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an ‘all-in-one’ solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyond ARD specification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided. Outputs of this module can be directly ingested into a geographic information system (GIS) to fuel research questions without any further processing, i.e., hARD+.

However, estimating their separate and combined effects remains a research challenge. In South Africa, streamflow dynamics are important not only for irrigated agriculture but also for many rural communities that depend on streamflow for domestic water supply. In this paper, we analysed the effects of pine, wattle and eucalyptus plantation cover change vis-à-vis the effects of inter-annual climate variability on streamflow dynamics of the Upper Umvoti River in South Africa from 1994 to 2016. We modelled inter-annual variability in streamflow by precipitation, temperature and plantation cover using the Bayesian inference. We mapped plantation cover from Landsat satellite imagery. We found strong evidence for an interaction between temperature range and plantation cover net change on streamflow. Specifically, the plantation effect weakened under conditions of high-temperature range anomalies. We explain this interaction with a shift in soil water repellency and interception capacity within the plantation area under a changing temperature range, with important implications for the formation of surface runoff. Previous studies have assumed that the effects of climate variability and plantation cover change on streamflow dynamics are independent. Our results call this assumption into question. Hence, climate and land cover interdependencies should be accounted for in future statistical and process-based modelling studies.","tags":null,"title":"Interdependent effects of climate variability and forest cover change on streamflow dynamics: a case study in the Upper Umvoti River Basin, South Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philippe Rufin","David Frantz","Stefan Ernst","Andreas Rabe","Patrick Griffiths","Mutlu Özdoğan"," Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b9185977fa16f9097862fb096c047747","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/rufin-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344237Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rufin-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatially explicit information on cropland use intensity is vital for monitoring land and water resource demands in agricultural systems. Cropping practices underlie substantial spatial and temporal variability, which can be captured through the analysis of image time series. Temporal binning helps to overcome limitations concerning operability and repeatability for mapping large areas and can improve the thematic detail and consistency of maps in agricultural systems. We here assessed the use of annual, quarterly, and eight-day temporal features for mapping five cropping practices on annual croplands across Turkey. We used 2403 atmospherically corrected and topographically normalized Landsat Collection 1 L1TP images of 2015 to compute quarterly best-pixel composites, quarterly and annual spectral-temporal metrics, as well as gap-filled eight-day time series of Tasseled Cap components. We tested 22 feature sets for binary cropland mapping, and subsequent discrimination of five cropping practices: Spring and winter cropping, summer cropping, semi-aquatic cropping, double cropping, and greenhouse cultivation. We evaluated area-adjusted accuracies and compared cropland area estimates at the province-level with official statistics. We achieved overall accuracies above 90%, when using either all quarterly features or the eight-day Tasseled Cap time series, indicating that temporal binning of intra-annual image time-series into multiple temporal features improves representations of cropping practices. Class accuracies of winter and spring, summer, and double cropping were robust, while omission errors for semi-aquatic cropping and greenhouse cultivation were high. Our mapped cropland extent was in good agreement with province-level statistics (r2 = 0.85, RMSE = 7.2%). Our results indicate that 71.3% (±2.3%) of Turkey’s annual croplands were cultivated during winter and spring, 15.8% (±2.2%) during summer, while 8.5% (±1.6%) were double-cropped, 4% (±1.9%) were cultivated under semi-aquatic conditions, and 0.32% (±0.2%) was greenhouse cultivation. Our study presents an open and readily available framework for detailed cropland mapping over large areas, which bears the potential to inform assessments of land use intensity, as well as land and water resource demands.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping Cropping Practices on a National Scale Using Intra-Annual Landsat Time Series Binning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha Nink","Joachim Hill","Johannes Stoffels","Henning Buddenbaum","David Frantz","Joachim Langshausen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3d61f1a6c30d596b4343b5b9b9ed1ec8","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/nink-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343108Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nink-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"From global monitoring to regional forest management there is an increasing demand for information about forest ecosystems. For border regions that are closely connected ecologically and economically, a key factor is the cross-border availability and consistency of up-to-date information such as the forest type. The combination of existing forest information with Earth observation data is a rational method and can provide valuable contribution to serve the increased information demand on a transnational level. We present an approach for the remote sensing-based generation of a transnational and temporally consistent forest type information layer for the German federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Existing forest information data from different countries were merged and combined with suitable vegetation indices derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery acquired in early spring. An automated bootstrap-based approximation of the optimum threshold for the distinction of “broadleaved” and “coniferous” forest was applied. The spatially explicit forest type information layer is updated annually depending on image availability. Overall accuracies between 79 and 96 percent were obtained. Every spot in the region will be updated successively within a period of expectably three years. The presented approach can be integrated in fully automated processing chains to generate basic forest type information layers on a regular basis.","tags":null,"title":"Using Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data for the Generation of Continuously Updated Forest Type Information Layers in a Cross-Border Region","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Supplement to: Frantz, David; Röder, Achim; Stellmes, Marion; Hill, Joachim (2016): An operational radiometric Landsat preprocessing framework for large-area time series applications.

In this paper, the general ACIX framework is discussed; special mention is made of the motivation to initiate the experiment, the inter-comparison protocol, and the principal results. ACIX is free and open and every developer was welcome to participate. Eventually, 12 participants applied their approaches to various Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 image datasets acquired over sites around the world. The current results diverge depending on the sensors, products, and sites, indicating their strengths and weaknesses.

Our study in NE Namibia and SW Zambia evaluated the potential of operational earth observation satellites to characterize land-use change processes and quantifi ed their impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient concentrations. We found that the area under agricultural use increased by 24% from 2002 to 2013, mainly at the expense of natural vegetation (i.e., woodland). This conversion caused a decline in SOC and total N and tended to increase plantavailable P in the soils of old agricultural fi elds. The eff ects were most pronounced in NE Namibia, where the total SOC stocks were 19.6% (±18.4 SD) lower in agricultural land compared to woodland. Moreover, the losses in SOC and total N tended to result in a decline of predicted maize yields calculated with the QUEFTS model by ~15% when comparing soils of old agricultural fi elds and woodland. Overall, our results indicate that long-term continuation of low-input arable farming can reduce soil fertility.","tags":null,"title":"Deforestation for agricultural expansion in SW Zambia and NE Namibia and the impacts on soil fertility, soil organic carbon- and nutrient levels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Erik Haß","Andreas Uhl","Johannes Stoffels","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5097d022590d777c86fa9ab28320de1e","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.339718Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Reliable identification of clouds is necessary for any type of optical remote sensing image analysis, especially in operational and fully automatic setups. One of the most elaborated and widespread algorithms, namely Fmask, was initially developed for the Landsat suite of satellites. Despite their similarity, application to Sentinel-2 imagery is currently hampered by the unavailability of a thermal band, and although results can be improved when taking the cirrus band into account, Sentinel-2 cloud detections are unsatisfactory in two points. (1) Low altitude clouds can be undetectable in the cirrus band, and (2) bright land surfaces – especially built-up structures – are often misclassified as clouds when only considering spectral information. In this paper, we present the Cloud Displacement Index (CDI), which makes use of the three highly correlated near infrared bands that are observed with different view angles. Hence, elevated objects like clouds are observed under a parallax and can be reliably separated from bright ground objects. We compare CDI with the currently used cloud probabilities, and propose how to integrate this new functionality into the Fmask algorithm. We validate the approach using test images over metropolitan areas covering a wide variety of global environments and climates, indicating the successful separation of clouds and built-up structures (overall accuracy 95%, i.e. an improvement in overall accuracy of 0.29–0.39 compared to the previous Fmask versions over the 20 test sites), and hence a full compensation for a missing thermal band.","tags":null,"title":"Improvement of the Fmask algorithm for Sentinel-2 images: Separating clouds from bright surfaces based on parallax effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anne Schneibel","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"cd7a832ab40c1c08d6e3f4e22eb7f72b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schneibel-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344823Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schneibel-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Dry tropical forests are facing large-scale conversion and degradation processes and are the most endangered forest type worldwide. We analyse these processes in the dry tropical forest type of miombo woodlands in a rural area of south-central Angola. We show that large-scale conversion to agricultural areas takes place in this area, as does modifi cation of woodland areas, i.e. by degradation due to the extraction of natural resources. By using remote sensing data, spatial drivers of this conversion and its eff ects may be assessed for the time period 1989?2013. We identify settlement dynamics and the location and quality of streets as major underlying determining factors for conversion processes. Since the 1980s, the rate of agricultural expansion has strongly depended on socioeconomic background factors and is currently on a level of ca. 9 000 ha/year in the study area. Fallows were found to only slowly regenerate, and there is a change in cultivation pattern to more permanent forms of cultivation.

The latter have sometimes needed to focus on small test sites for very specifi c questions, or else required data and methods that allowed large area assessments. In either situation it is important that the studies are founded on consistent and comparable data. Responding to this requirement, a range of products based on operational earth observation satellite systems has been developed in the frame of SASSCAL. Here, we introduce the most relevant primary and derived products at coarse (250?500 m MODIS) and medium (30 m Landsat) spatial resolution, describe their basic properties, and provide examples of application as an impetus for further research. At the same time, alternative sources of data and advances in sensor systems off er high potential in complementing information from operational products, or provide further insights into specifi c local questions. We thus briefl y touch upon the potential of such systems, including active sensing and/or airborne technologies such as Synthetic Aperture Radar, Light Detection and Ranging, use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and hyperspectral imaging, and introduce studies carried under SASSCAL using these systems.","tags":null,"title":"Remote sensing-based environmental assessment and monitoring – generation of operational baseline and enhanced experimental products in southern Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1253e1412c0ff38c1947c80bdf93dfbb","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/sattgruen/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sattgruen/","section":"project","summary":"Role: Associated","tags":["running"],"title":"SattGrün","type":"project"},{"authors":["David Parduhn","David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"775b227190fc27612e9c526495d9cd5d","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/parduhn-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343386Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parduhn-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Zambia has been losing about 250,000 ha of forest annually.

These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming. We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5–8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994–1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailed information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics. We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing.","tags":null,"title":"Assessment of spatio-temporal changes of smallholder cultivation patterns in the Angolan Miombo belt using segmentation of Landsat time series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erik Haß","David Frantz","Sebastian Mader","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"82b1b2ffeb5af9b2f6e6bc583d4d0c4b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/hass-2017/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.342251Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hass-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Image compositing enables the generation of continuous and equidistant time series of vegetation indices (VIs) as a requisite for deriving phenological metrics. This is achieved by selecting a representative choice from available observations within a compositing period. Commonly, phenological processors associate the VI value with a reference date rather than the actual acquisition date. This letter focuses on a global assessment of the resulting temporal discrepancy between the assumed reference date and the actual acquisition date using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-VI day of composite (DOC) information from 2000 to 2015. It is shown that the long-term global mean DOC coincides with the midday of a compositing period (day 8.44 ± 0.44). The global summarized 2-D frequency distributions of succeeding compositing periods revealed that only 16.93% of all occurrences indicate a 16-day difference. The commonly used assumptions that the DOC coincides with the first, mid, or last day of the compositing period on average only hold true for 7.02%, 6.07%, and 6.03% of temporal succeeding compositing periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of 2-D frequency distributions occur as a result of climatic regions and seasonality. A MODIS tile is on average composed of more than 50% DOC combinations, indicating deviations (1-31 days) from the 16-day difference. Since information about the actual acquisition date is available, and methods for the incorporation of irregular data into phenological analysis do exist, it is recommended to incorporate this information into the phenology research based on VI time series to avoid unnecessary uncertainty.","tags":null,"title":"Global Analysis of the Differences Between the MODIS Vegetation Index Compositing Date and the Actual Acquisition Date","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"f75b96314d95a546a141c07fc06a2eee","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2017/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.340585Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The need for operational monitoring of landscape processes on the national to global scale led to an increased demand for pixel-based composites using complete earth observation (EO) archives. Commonly, composites are generated without explicit consideration of temporal criteria but are rather based on optimizing band indices within a pre-defined temporal window. However, for certain applications phenology-adapted composites that represent the land surface as being in the same phenological stage are required, e.g. tree type discrimination where greening up or senescence dates are modified by terrain elevation. We developed a novel pixel-based compositing technique that dynamically adjusts the selection process to the underlying land surface phenology (LSP) of each pixel. By doing so, phenologically sound composites across large areas can be derived for regular intervals and different phenological points in time, e.g. peak, end or minimum of season. Various day-of-year (DOY) scoring functions were implemented to flexibly define the phenological target. The technique is general enough for global application and can be applied to any kind of gridded EO archive, herein demonstrated for MODIS and Landsat data. Multi-annual composites were successfully generated for Zambia for most seasons. As an exception, we found even very frequent MODIS observations to be insufficient for peak vegetation composites due to interference with the rainy season. The phenology-adaptive composites were compared to static ones, i.e. using a single target DOY. Results clearly indicated that biomass levels differ significantly between the techniques, and a phenological normalization across elevation gradients and land cover classes could be achieved. However, the implications are non-trivial and the characteristics of both methods need to be considered cautiously before deciding which approach is superior with regards to a specific thematic application. The quality of the MODIS and Landsat composites, as well as the performance of the phenology-adaptive and static compositing techniques were assured using a quantitative cross-comparison. A 12-year annual time series demonstrated the feasibility for land cover change and modification mapping. Several change processes were clearly discriminable. The resulting phenologically coherent composites are important to establish national, regional or even global landscape monitoring, reporting and verification systems.","tags":null,"title":"Phenology-adaptive pixel-based compositing using optical earth observation imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anne Schneibel","David Frantz","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","Kim Fischer","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"bd9109db67045796cbd0f50821689198","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schneibel-2017b/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344534Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schneibel-2017b/","section":"publication","summary":"Dry tropical forests undergo massive conversion and degradation processes. This also holds true for the extensive Miombo forests that cover large parts of Southern Africa. While the largest proportional area can be found in Angola, the country still struggles with food shortages, insufficient medical and educational supplies, as well as the ongoing reconstruction of infrastructure after 27 years of civil war. Especially in rural areas, the local population is therefore still heavily dependent on the consumption of natural resources, as well as subsistence agriculture. This leads, on one hand, to large areas of Miombo forests being converted for cultivation purposes, but on the other hand, to degradation processes due to the selective use of forest resources. While forest conversion in south-central rural Angola has already been quantitatively described, information about forest degradation is not yet available. This is due to the history of conflicts and the therewith connected research difficulties, as well as the remote location of this area. We apply an annual time series approach using Landsat data in south-central Angola not only to assess the current degradation status of the Miombo forests, but also to derive past developments reaching back to times of armed conflicts. We use the Disturbance Index based on tasseled cap transformation to exclude external influences like inter-annual variation of rainfall. Based on this time series, linear regression is calculated for forest areas unaffected by conversion, but also for the pre-conversion period of those areas that were used for cultivation purposes during the observation time. Metrics derived from linear regression are used to classify the study area according to their dominant modification processes. We compare our results to MODIS latent integral trends and to further products to derive information on underlying drivers. Around 13% of the Miombo forests are affected by degradation processes, especially along streets, in villages, and close to existing agriculture. However, areas in presumably remote and dense forest areas are also affected to a significant extent. A comparison with MODIS derived fire ignition data shows that they are most likely affected by recurring fires and less by selective timber extraction. We confirm that areas that are used for agriculture are more heavily disturbed by selective use beforehand than those that remain unaffected by conversion. The results can be substantiated by the MODIS latent integral trends and we also show that due to extent and location, the assessment of forest conversion is most likely not sufficient to provide good estimates for the loss of natural resources.","tags":null,"title":"Using Annual Landsat Time Series for the Detection of Dry Forest Degradation Processes in South-Central Angola","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill\nPrecision Forestry 2016: Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 21 December 2016, Trier, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1482278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1482278400,"objectID":"449c5089157d5e80299e55439f09472a","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb037/","publishdate":"2016-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb037/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill @ Precision Forestry 2016: Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 21 December 2016, Trier, Germany","tags":["2016"],"title":"Sentinel4GRIPS - Aufbereitung von Satellitenbildarchiven zur Charakterisierung von Waldsystemen","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill\nVeränderungserkennung mittels Fernerkundungsdaten, 8-9 November 2016, Koblenz, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1478563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478563200,"objectID":"105f8a162828193e67ea95aaa03286d7","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb038/","publishdate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb038/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill @ Veränderungserkennung mittels Fernerkundungsdaten, 8-9 November 2016, Koblenz, Germany","tags":["2016"],"title":"Integration von Sentinel-2 Daten in die automatisierte Level-2 Prozessierung von Erdbeobachtungsdaten","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470009600,"objectID":"ba619ecb3ba8309fe3615057d618f8f2","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/sentinel4grips/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sentinel4grips/","section":"project","summary":"Role: Researcher","tags":["completed"],"title":"Sentinel4GRIPS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marion Stellmes, David Frantz, Manfred Finckh, Rasmus Revermann, Achim Röder, Vera De Cauwer, Anne Schneibel, Joachim Hill\nGEO BON 2016 Open Science Conference \u0026amp;

Cloud and cloud shadow detection is performed by a modified Fmask code. Surface reflectance is inferred from Tanré's formulation of the radiative transfer, including adjacency effect correction. A precompiled MODIS water vapor database provides daily or climatological fallback estimates. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is estimated over dark objects (DOs) that are identified in a combined database and image-based approach, where information on their temporal persistency is utilized. AOD is inferred with consideration of the actual target reflectance and background contamination effect. In case of absent DOs in bright scenes, a fallback approach with a modeled AOD climatology is used instead. Topographic normalization is performed by a modified C-correction. The data are projected into a single coordinate system and are organized in a gridded data structure for simplified pixel-based access. We based the assessment of the produced data set on an exhaustive analysis of overlapping pixels: 98.8% of the redundant overlaps are in the range of the expected ±2.5% overall radiometric algorithm accuracy. AOD is in very good agreement with Aerosol Robotic Network sunphotometer data (R 2 : 0.72 to 0.79, low intercepts, and slopes near unity). The uncertainty in using the water vapor fallback climatology is approximately ±2.8% for the TM SWIR1 band in the wet season. The topographic correction was considered successful by an investigation of the nonrelationship between the illumination angle and the corrected radiance.","tags":null,"title":"An Operational Radiometric Landsat Preprocessing Framework for Large-Area Time Series Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anne Schneibel","Marion Stellmes","Achim Röder","Manfred Finckh","Rasmus Revermann","David Frantz","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ae965d6a9d58acd19a57baf51bbf0775","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schneibel-2016/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.345113Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schneibel-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The repopulation of abandoned areas in Angola after 27 years of civil war led to a fast and extensive expansion of agricultural fields to meet the rising food demand. Yet, the increase in crop production at the expense of natural resources carries an inherent potential for conflicts since the demand for timber and wood extraction are also supposed to rise. We use the concept of ecosystem services to evaluate the trade-off between food and woody biomass. Our study area is located in central Angola, in the highlands of the upper Okavango catchment. We used Landsat data (spatial resolution: 30 × 30 m) with a bi-temporal and multi-seasonal change detection approach for five time steps between 1989 and 2013 to estimate the conversion area from woodland to agriculture. Overall accuracy is 95%, user's accuracy varies from 89–95% and producer's accuracy ranges between 92–99%. To quantify the trade-off between woody biomass and the amount of food, this information was combined with indicator values and we furthermore assessed biomass regrowth on fallows. Our results reveal a constant rise in agricultural expansion from 1989–2013 with the mean annual deforestation rate increasing from roughly 5300 ha up to about 12,000 ha. Overall, 5.6% of the forested areas were converted to agriculture, whereas the FAO states a national deforestation rate for Angola of 5% from 1990–2010 (FAO, 2010). In the last time step 961,000 t per year of woodland were cleared to potentially produce 1240 t per year of maize. Current global agro-economical projections forecast increasing pressure on tropical dry forests from large-scale agriculture schemes (Gasparri et al., 2015; Searchinger and Heimlich, 2015). Our study underlines the importance of considering subsistence-related change processes, which may contribute significantly to negative effects associated with deforestation and degradation of these forest ecosystems.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating the Trade-Off Between Food and Timber Resulting from the Conversion of Miombo Forests to Agricultural Land in Angola Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Marion Stellmes","Achim Röder","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"24c9ba0d63dc2507ae37c47d1af38fa2","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2016e/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.341693Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2016e/","section":"publication","summary":"Fire spread information on a large scale is still a missing key layer for a complete description of fire regimes. We developed a novel multilevel object-based methodology that extracts valuable information about fire dynamics from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area data. Besides the large area capabilities, this approach also derives very detailed information for every single fire regarding timing and location of its ignition, as well as detailed directional multitemporal spread information. The approach is a top–down approach and a multilevel segmentation strategy is used to gradually refine the individual object membership. The multitemporal segmentation alternates between recursive seed point identification and queue-based fire tracking. The algorithm relies on only a few input parameters that control the segmentation with spatial and temporal distance thresholds. We present exemplary results that indicate the potential for further use of the derived parameters.","tags":null,"title":"Fire spread from MODIS burned area data: obtaining fire dynamics information for every single fire","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Achim Röder","Thomas Udelhoven","Michael Schmidt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d7c53946643c96c21997fb7bef9b1428","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2016c/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.341134Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2016c/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatio-temporal information on process-based forest loss is essential for a wide range of applications. Despite remote sensing being the only feasible means of monitoring forest change at regional or greater scales, there is no retrospectively available remote sensor that meets the demand of monitoring forests with the required spatial detail and guaranteed high temporal frequency. As an alternative, we employed the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to produce a dense synthetic time series by fusing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) adjusted reflectance. Forest loss was detected by applying a multi-temporal disturbance detection approach implementing a Disturbance Index-based detection strategy. The detection thresholds were permutated with random numbers for the normal distribution in order to generate a multi-dimensional threshold confidence area. As a result, a more robust parameterization and a spatially more coherent detection could be achieved. (i) The original Landsat time series; (ii) synthetic time series; and a (iii) combined hybrid approach were used to identify the timing and extent of disturbances. The identified clearings in the Landsat detection were verified using an annual woodland clearing dataset from Queensland’s Statewide Landcover and Trees Study. Disturbances caused by stand-replacing events were successfully identified. The increased temporal resolution of the synthetic time series indicated promising additional information on disturbance timing. The results of the hybrid detection unified the benefits of both approaches, i.e., the spatial quality and general accuracy of the Landsat detection and the increased temporal information of synthetic time series. Results indicated that a temporal improvement in the detection of the disturbance date could be achieved relative to the irregularly spaced Landsat data for sufficiently large patches.","tags":null,"title":"Forest Disturbance Mapping Using Dense Synthetic Landsat/MODIS Time-Series and Permutation-Based Disturbance Index Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Marion Stellmes","Achim Röder","Thomas Udelhoven","Sebastian Mader","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"fccfb53daefb146d1062713ad083259f","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2016b/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.34197Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2016b/","section":"publication","summary":"Satellite-derived land surface phenology (LSP) serves as a valuable input source for many environmental applications such as land cover classifications and global change studies. Commonly, LSP is derived from coarse-resolution (CR) sensors due to their well-suited temporal resolution. However, LSP is increasingly demanded at medium resolution (MR), but inferring LSP directly from MR imagery remains a challenging task (e.g., due to acquisition frequency). As such, we present a methodology that directly predicts MR LSP on the basis of the respective CR LSP and MR reflectance imagery. The approach considers information from the local pixel neighborhood at both resolutions by utilizing several prediction proxies, including spectral distance and multiscale heterogeneity metrics. The prediction performs well with simulated data (R2=0.84), and the approach substantially reduces noise. The size of the smallest reliably predicted object coincides with the effective CR pixel size (i.e., field-of-view). Nevertheless, even subpixel objects can be reliably predicted provided that pure CR pixels are located within the search radius. The application to real MODIS LSP and Landsat reflectance well preserves the phenological landscape composition, and the spatial refinement is especially striking in heterogeneous agricultural areas, where, for example, the circular shape of center pivot irrigation schemes is successfully restored at MR.","tags":null,"title":"Improving the Spatial Resolution of Land Surface Phenology by Fusing Medium- and Coarse-Resolution Inputs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rasmus Revermann","Manfred Finckh","Marion Stellmes","Ben Strohbach","David Frantz","Jens Oldeland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d170c498342536be809e96bf54033220","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/revermann-2016/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343655Z","relpermalink":"/publication/revermann-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"In many parts of Africa, spatially-explicit information on plant α-diversity, i.e., the number of species in a given area, is missing as baseline information for spatial planning. We present an approach on how to combine vegetation-plot databases and remotely-sensed land surface phenology (LSP) metrics to predict plant α-diversity on a regional scale. We gathered data on plant α-diversity, measured as species density, from 999 vegetation plots sized 20 m × 50 m covering all major vegetation units of the Okavango basin in the countries of Angola, Namibia and Botswana. As predictor variables, we used MODIS LSP metrics averaged over 12 years (250-m spatial resolution) and three topographic attributes calculated from the SRTM digital elevation model. Furthermore, we tested whether additional climatic data could improve predictions. We tested three predictor subsets: (1) remote sensing variables; (2) climatic variables; and (3) all variables combined. We used two statistical modeling approaches, random forests and boosted regression trees, to predict vascular plant α-diversity. The resulting maps showed that the Miombo woodlands of the Angolan Central Plateau featured the highest diversity, and the lowest values were predicted for the thornbush savanna in the Okavango Delta area. Models built on the entire dataset exhibited the best performance followed by climate-only models and remote sensing-only models. However, models including climate data showed artifacts. In spite of lower model performance, models based only on LSP metrics produced the most realistic maps. Furthermore, they revealed local differences in plant diversity of the landscape mosaic that were blurred by homogenous belts as predicted by climate-based models. This study pinpoints the high potential of LSP metrics used in conjunction with biodiversity data derived from vegetation-plot databases to produce spatial information on a regional scale that is urgently needed for basic natural resource management applications.","tags":null,"title":"Linking Land Surface Phenology and Vegetation-Plot Databases to Model Terrestrial Plant α-Diversity of the Okavango Basin","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill\nPrecision Forestry - Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 18 December 2015, Trier, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1450396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1450396800,"objectID":"795a385df521ecee3045d7514c3adbca","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb046/","publishdate":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb046/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill @ Precision Forestry - Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 18 December 2015, Trier, Germany","tags":["2015"],"title":"Die Etablierung automatisierter Prozessierungsumgebungen zur künftigen Nutzung von Sentinel-2 Datenarchiven","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill\nGemeinsame Jahrestagung der Arbeitskreise Fernerkundung (DGfG \u0026amp; DGPF), 24-25 September 2015, Bonn, Germany  oral presentation\n","date":1443052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443052800,"objectID":"d6e5f179e20b0bb9e5096c0089e83868","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb047/","publishdate":"2015-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb047/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill @ 4.

The first step consists of detecting clouds and cloud shadows in every Landsat image independently by using the Fmask algorithm. We modified two features of the original Fmask: we dropped the termination criterion for shadow matching, and we appended a darkness filter to counteract false positives in bifidly structured dryland areas. The second step utilizes the scene-by-scene detections of the first step and additional time series of cloud and cloud shadow probabilities. All clear-sky observations of a pixel are used to estimate the probabilities' median and standard deviation. Any observation that deviates more than a multiple of the standard deviation from the median is considered an outlier and thus a remaining cloud or cloud shadow. The method was specifically designed for use in water-limited dryland areas, where event-based precipitation is predominant. As an effect, green vegetation peaks are highly variable, in timing, magnitude, and frequency, with adverse effects on commonly used Fourier-based outlier detection methods. The method is designed to be robust even if temporally dense data coverage is not available.","tags":null,"title":"Enhancing the Detectability of Clouds and Their Shadows in Multitemporal Dryland Landsat Imagery: Extending Fmask","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"a8369f2330f4d2fe1e622ac4315f4b69","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2015b/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.340017Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2015b/","section":"publication","summary":"We developed a spatio-temporal path reflectance climatology for use in atmospheric corrections for a Landsat pre-processing framework. The climatology is intended as a fallback strategy for aerosol estimation in bright Southern African savannah ecosystems where the rarity of dark objects decreases the applicability of common image-based aerosol estimation strategies and the widespread burning prohibits the use of a fixed aerosol loading. We predicted the climatological path reflectance surface by applying a multivariate regression model to all available path reflectance retrievals on basis of the geolocation and the days of the year on which the data were acquired. The resulting predictions are able to successfully model major spatio-temporal gradients of the path reflectance distribution. The prediction error (weighted root mean squared Error at 0.483 µm) was less than 1% reflectance while the prediction itself varied by 4.6% reflectance. Thus, using the modelled climatology for atmospheric correction is favourable compared to a fixed aerosol content.","tags":null,"title":"On the Derivation of a Spatially Distributed Aerosol Climatology for its Incorporation in a Radiometric Landsat Preprocessing Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marion Stellmes, David Frantz, Achim Röder, Torsten Weber, Joachim Hill\nGlobal Land Project (GLP) Open Science Meeting, Berlin, Germany, 19-21 March\noral presentation\n","date":1395187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1395187200,"objectID":"9d1f8b507177879e5fe7c9a91d63a9fc","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb056/","publishdate":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb056/","section":"presentation","summary":"Marion Stellmes, David Frantz, Achim Röder, Torsten  Weber, Joachim Hill @ Global Land Project (GLP) Open Science Meeting, Berlin, Germany, 19-21 March","tags":["old"],"title":"A multi-component characterization of the active Okavango Catchment and Delta based on various MODIS products","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Thomas Udelhoven, Michael Schmidt\nGlobal Land Project (GLP) Open Science Meeting, Berlin, Germany, 19-21 March\noral presentation\n","date":1395187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1395187200,"objectID":"a321452b3d22b00a862b283e5795e4ae","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb055/","publishdate":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb055/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Thomas Udelhoven, Michael Schmidt @ Global Land Project (GLP) Open Science Meeting, Berlin, Germany, 19-21 March","tags":["old"],"title":"Characterization of forest disturbance using data-blending techniques applied to MODIS and Landsat time series in an Australian Savanna","type":"presentation"},{"authors":["Miriam Machwitz","Laura Giustarini","Christian Bossung","David Frantz","Martin Schlerf","Holger Lilienthal","Loise Wandera","Patrick Matgen","Lucien Hoffmann","Thomas Udelhoven"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"93cf4996928c2856d3a929d79fc28abc","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/machwitz-2014/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.342817Z","relpermalink":"/publication/machwitz-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Complex crop growth models (CGM) require a large number of input parameters, which can cause large errors if they are uncertain. Furthermore, they often lack spatial information. The coupling of a CGM with a radiative transfer model offers the possibility to assimilate remote sensing data while taking into account uncertainties in input parameters. A particle filter was used to assimilate satellite data into a CGM coupled with a leaf-canopy radiative transfer model to update biomass simulations of maize. The synthetic experiment set up to test the reliability of the procedure, highlighted the importance of the acquisition time. The real case study with RapidEye observations confirmed these findings. Data assimilation increased the accuracy of biomass predictions in the majority of the six maize fields where biomass validation data was available, with improvements of up to 15%. The smallest and largest errors in biomass prediction after assimilation were 82 kg/ha and 2116 kg/ha, respectively. Furthermore, data assimilation enabled the production of biomass maps showing detailed spatial variability.","tags":null,"title":"Enhanced biomass prediction by assimilating satellite data into a crop growth model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1370044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1370044800,"objectID":"f325a6d86f1a4a060a49c6b28bb0493e","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/sasscal/","publishdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sasscal/","section":"project","summary":"Role: PhD","tags":["completed"],"title":"SASSCAL","type":"project"},{"authors":["Marion Stellmes","David Frantz","Manfred Finckh","Rasmus Revermann","Achim Röder","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"84de4c2293d231cde467960e1893b10b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/stellmes-2013/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.345708Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stellmes-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"The analysis and evaluation of ecosystems in the Okavango region must include a thorough analysis of the fire regime. This requires a full understanding of its components such as fire frequency, fire season and fire intensity. For the Okavango region these components were derived based on an extensive multi-scale compilation of the MODIS products “Active Fire” (AF) and “Burned Area” (BA) covering the period 2001 to 2012. The integrated analysis of these mutually exclusive datasets allowed for a comprehensive characterisation of important descriptors of the large scale fire regime. The descriptive fire parameters are discussed considering dominant land cover classes. These were derived by clustering phenological metrics which were in turn derived by analysing temporally dense MODIS time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).The variation within the study area regarding the overall area affected by fire, the fire frequency as well as the fire seasonality can be explained to a high degree by land cover and local human fire management practises. Thus, Miombo woodlands are less affected by fires than other vegetation communities like for instance thornbush savannahs or grasslands in the river valleys of the upper catchment.We provide a considerable overview of spatial and temporal fire dynamics within the Okavango region. This is an important step in generating the necessary information required to feed into land use management scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Fire Frequency, Fire Seasonality and Fire Intensity within the Okavango Region Derived from MODIS Fire Products","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"M.
