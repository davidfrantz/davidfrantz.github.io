Sentinel-2 is equipped with a water vapor channel, and thus, water wapor amount can be estimated from the images.\nLandsat, however, doesn't have such a band. Therefore, we need to rely on external data, which needs to be precompiled into a water vapor database.\nWater Vapor Database The database holds water vapor values for the central coordinates of each WRS-2 frame. If available, day-specific values are used.\nThe database consists of one table for each day (WVP_YYYY-MM-DD.txt)\nls /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-*  /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-01.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-02.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-03.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-04.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-05.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-06.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-07.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-08.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-09.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-10.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-11.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-12.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-13.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-14.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-15.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-16.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-17.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-18.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-19.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-20.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-21.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-22.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-23.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-24.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-25.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-26.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-27.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-28.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-29.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-30.txt /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/WVP_2010-07-31.txt  Each file includes one value per coordinate.

(2019). A Global MODIS Water Vapor Database for the Operational Atmospheric Correction of Historic and Recent Landsat Imagery. Remote Sensing, 11, 257. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11030257\nPrepare the WVDB We generally use a WVDB generated from MODIS water vapor products (MOD05 and MYD05).\nDownload the ready-to-go global WVDB You should start by downloading the pre-compiled WVDB with global coverage from here. This saves you a lot of processing. This freely available dataset was generated with the FORCE WVDB component, and is comprised of daily global water vapor data for February 2000 to July 2018 for each land-intersecting WRS-2 scene (13281 coordinates), as well as a monthly climatology that can be used if no daily value is available.\nGenerate the WVDB on your own We try to update this dataset in regular intervals. However, if you are in need of more up-to-date data, you can use the FORCE WVDB component to generate/update these tables on your own. FORCE WVDB needs a table with input coordinates (center coordinates of WRS-2 frames). The pre-compiled dataset includes such a table. If you are not interested in global coverage, you can subset this file. The file should contain two columns separated by white space, and no header. The first column should give the longitude (X), the second column the latitude (Y) with coordinates in decimal degree (negative values for West/South). Any other column is ignored (in the example below, the WRS-2 Path/Row is in the third column).\nwc -l /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/wrs-2-land.coo  13281 /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/wrs-2-land.coo  head /data/Earth/global/wvp/wvdb/wrs-2-land.coo  -15.39340494140 80.76026666750 013001 -22.86543244600 80.00558606640 013002 -29.22356065160 79.11366800820 013003 -34.59295680040 78.11513723200 013004 -39.12687451150 77.03430642440 013005 -42.97184515330 75.88984431700 013006 -46.25519224080 74.69581438230 013007 -49.08160498390 73.46286239410 013008 -51.53569902300 72.19888348300 013009 -53.68466715610 70.91003752470 013010  FORCE WVDB downloads each Terra/Aqua granule (collection 6.1) that intersects with any of these coordinates. The files are downloaded from the Level1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Note that any permanent or temporary change/shutdown/decommissioning on LAADS’ or MODIS’ end may result in the nonfunctioning of FORCE WVDB\u0026hellip; Also note, that they perform a weekly maintenance, during which their servers are not accessable.\nAs with any other FORCE program, you can display short usage instructions by executing the program without any parameters.\nforce-lut-modis  usage: force-lut-modis coords dir-wvp dir-geometa dir-eoshdf [start-year start-month start-day end-year end-month end-day]  A coordinate file needs to be given as 1st argument.\nThe MODIS data are downloaded to dir-eoshdf (this directory must exist). MODIS data that are already in dir-eoshdf are not downloaded again. If the tool crashes because a dataset is corrupt, it is necessary to manually delete this file and run the tool again. Unfortunately, this happens from time to time due to incomplete downloads or if LAADS is unresponsive. The program attempts to re-download a corrupt file up to 10 times, but this error can occur nonetheless.\nMOD05/MYD05 data are swath products, and MOD03/MYD03 geometa tables are necessary to relate coordinates to MODIS granules. The geometa tables are downloaded to dir-geometa (this directory must exist). Tables that are already in dir-geometa are not downloaded again. If the tool crashes because a table is invalid, it is necessary to manually delete this file and run the tool again. Unfortunately, this happens from time to time due to incomplete downloads or if LAADS is unresponsive. The program attempts to re-download a corrupt file up to 10 times, but this error can occur nonetheless.\nThe final water vapor tables are saved in dir-wvp (this directory must exist). Tables that are already in dir-wvp are not processed again (i.e. no download of geometa tables and hdf files).\nThe start and end arguments are optional and may be used for parallelization. If they are not given, FORCE WVDB will download the entire time series of all coordinates provided (this can be a lot!).\nThis directory is the directory, to which DIR_WVPLUT in the FORCE L2PS parameter file should refer.

The freely available software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring) is capable of generating Landsat ARD. An essential step of generating ARD is atmospheric correction, which requires water vapor data. FORCE relies on a water vapor database obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, two major drawbacks arise from this strategy: (1) The database has to be compiled for each study area prior to generating ARD; and (2) MODIS and Landsat commissioning dates are not well aligned. We have therefore compiled an application-ready global water vapor database to significantly increase the operational readiness of ARD production. The free dataset comprises daily water vapor data for February 2000 to July 2018 as well as a monthly climatology that is used if no daily value is available. We systematically assessed the impact of using this climatology on surface reflectance outputs. A global random sample of Landsat 5/7/8 imagery was processed twice (i) using daily water vapor (reference) and (ii) using the climatology (estimate), followed by computing accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (APU) metrics. All APU measures were well below specification, thus the fallback usage of the climatology is generally a sound strategy. Still, the tests revealed that some considerations need to be taken into account to help quantify which sensor, band, climate, and season are most or least affected by using a fallback climatology. The highest uncertainty and bias is found for Landsat 5, with progressive improvements towards newer sensors. The bias increases from dry to humid climates, whereas uncertainty increases from dry and tropic to temperate climates. Uncertainty is smallest during seasons with low variability, and is highest when atmospheric conditions progress from a dry to a wet season (and vice versa).","tags":null,"title":"A Global MODIS Water Vapor Database for the Operational Atmospheric Correction of Historic and Recent Landsat Imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"72fdb55c0ec41767126ca36431a4729b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2019a/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.339432Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2019a/","section":"publication","summary":"Ever increasing data volumes of satellite constellations call for multi-sensor analysis ready data (ARD) that relieve users from the burden of all costly preprocessing steps. This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an ‘all-in-one’ solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyond ARD specification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided. Outputs of this module can be directly ingested into a geographic information system (GIS) to fuel research questions without any further processing, i.e., hARD+.

However, estimating their separate and combined effects remains a research challenge. In South Africa, streamflow dynamics are important not only for irrigated agriculture but also for many rural communities that depend on streamflow for domestic water supply. In this paper, we analysed the effects of pine, wattle and eucalyptus plantation cover change vis-à-vis the effects of inter-annual climate variability on streamflow dynamics of the Upper Umvoti River in South Africa from 1994 to 2016. We modelled inter-annual variability in streamflow by precipitation, temperature and plantation cover using the Bayesian inference. We mapped plantation cover from Landsat satellite imagery. We found strong evidence for an interaction between temperature range and plantation cover net change on streamflow. Specifically, the plantation effect weakened under conditions of high-temperature range anomalies. We explain this interaction with a shift in soil water repellency and interception capacity within the plantation area under a changing temperature range, with important implications for the formation of surface runoff. Previous studies have assumed that the effects of climate variability and plantation cover change on streamflow dynamics are independent. Our results call this assumption into question. Hence, climate and land cover interdependencies should be accounted for in future statistical and process-based modelling studies.","tags":null,"title":"Interdependent effects of climate variability and forest cover change on streamflow dynamics: a case study in the Upper Umvoti River Basin, South Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philippe Rufin","David Frantz","Stefan Ernst","Andreas Rabe","Patrick Griffiths","Mutlu Özdoğan"," Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b9185977fa16f9097862fb096c047747","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/rufin-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344237Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rufin-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatially explicit information on cropland use intensity is vital for monitoring land and water resource demands in agricultural systems. Cropping practices underlie substantial spatial and temporal variability, which can be captured through the analysis of image time series. Temporal binning helps to overcome limitations concerning operability and repeatability for mapping large areas and can improve the thematic detail and consistency of maps in agricultural systems. We here assessed the use of annual, quarterly, and eight-day temporal features for mapping five cropping practices on annual croplands across Turkey. We used 2403 atmospherically corrected and topographically normalized Landsat Collection 1 L1TP images of 2015 to compute quarterly best-pixel composites, quarterly and annual spectral-temporal metrics, as well as gap-filled eight-day time series of Tasseled Cap components. We tested 22 feature sets for binary cropland mapping, and subsequent discrimination of five cropping practices: Spring and winter cropping, summer cropping, semi-aquatic cropping, double cropping, and greenhouse cultivation. We evaluated area-adjusted accuracies and compared cropland area estimates at the province-level with official statistics. We achieved overall accuracies above 90%, when using either all quarterly features or the eight-day Tasseled Cap time series, indicating that temporal binning of intra-annual image time-series into multiple temporal features improves representations of cropping practices. Class accuracies of winter and spring, summer, and double cropping were robust, while omission errors for semi-aquatic cropping and greenhouse cultivation were high. Our mapped cropland extent was in good agreement with province-level statistics (r2 = 0.85, RMSE = 7.2%). Our results indicate that 71.3% (±2.3%) of Turkey’s annual croplands were cultivated during winter and spring, 15.8% (±2.2%) during summer, while 8.5% (±1.6%) were double-cropped, 4% (±1.9%) were cultivated under semi-aquatic conditions, and 0.32% (±0.2%) was greenhouse cultivation. Our study presents an open and readily available framework for detailed cropland mapping over large areas, which bears the potential to inform assessments of land use intensity, as well as land and water resource demands.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping Cropping Practices on a National Scale Using Intra-Annual Landsat Time Series Binning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha Nink","Joachim Hill","Johannes Stoffels","Henning Buddenbaum","David Frantz","Joachim Langshausen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3d61f1a6c30d596b4343b5b9b9ed1ec8","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/nink-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343108Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nink-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"From global monitoring to regional forest management there is an increasing demand for information about forest ecosystems. For border regions that are closely connected ecologically and economically, a key factor is the cross-border availability and consistency of up-to-date information such as the forest type. The combination of existing forest information with Earth observation data is a rational method and can provide valuable contribution to serve the increased information demand on a transnational level. We present an approach for the remote sensing-based generation of a transnational and temporally consistent forest type information layer for the German federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Existing forest information data from different countries were merged and combined with suitable vegetation indices derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery acquired in early spring. An automated bootstrap-based approximation of the optimum threshold for the distinction of “broadleaved” and “coniferous” forest was applied. The spatially explicit forest type information layer is updated annually depending on image availability. Overall accuracies between 79 and 96 percent were obtained. Every spot in the region will be updated successively within a period of expectably three years. The presented approach can be integrated in fully automated processing chains to generate basic forest type information layers on a regular basis.","tags":null,"title":"Using Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data for the Generation of Continuously Updated Forest Type Information Layers in a Cross-Border Region","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Supplement to: Frantz, David; Röder, Achim; Stellmes, Marion; Hill, Joachim (2016): An operational radiometric Landsat preprocessing framework for large-area time series applications.

Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (ACIX) is an international initiative with the aim to analyse the Surface Reflectance (SR) products of various state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors. The Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) and Water Vapour (WV) are also examined in ACIX as additional outputs of AC processing. In this paper, the general ACIX framework is discussed; special mention is made of the motivation to initiate the experiment, the inter-comparison protocol, and the principal results. ACIX is free and open and every developer was welcome to participate. Eventually, 12 participants applied their approaches to various Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 image datasets acquired over sites around the world. The current results diverge depending on the sensors, products, and sites, indicating their strengths and weaknesses. Indeed, this first implementation of processor inter-comparison was proven to be a good lesson for the developers to learn the advantages and limitations of their approaches. Various algorithm improvements are expected, if not already implemented, and the enhanced performances are yet to be assessed in future ACIX experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Atmospheric Correction Inter-Comparison Exercise","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marleen de Blécourt","Achim Röder","Alexander Gröngröft","Stephan Baumann","David Frantz","Annette Eschenbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0daf1e4895c6ad814777a6dd16acb6c2","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/blecourt-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.338608Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blecourt-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"In southern African drylands, an important driver of deforestation is the ongoing conversion of woodland to smallholder agriculture. Our study in NE Namibia and SW Zambia evaluated the potential of operational earth observation satellites to characterize land-use change processes and quantifi ed their impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient concentrations. We found that the area under agricultural use increased by 24% from 2002 to 2013, mainly at the expense of natural vegetation (i.e., woodland). This conversion caused a decline in SOC and total N and tended to increase plantavailable P in the soils of old agricultural fi elds. The eff ects were most pronounced in NE Namibia, where the total SOC stocks were 19.6% (±18.4 SD) lower in agricultural land compared to woodland. Moreover, the losses in SOC and total N tended to result in a decline of predicted maize yields calculated with the QUEFTS model by ~15% when comparing soils of old agricultural fi elds and woodland. Overall, our results indicate that long-term continuation of low-input arable farming can reduce soil fertility.","tags":null,"title":"Deforestation for agricultural expansion in SW Zambia and NE Namibia and the impacts on soil fertility, soil organic carbon- and nutrient levels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Erik Haß","Andreas Uhl","Johannes Stoffels","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5097d022590d777c86fa9ab28320de1e","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.339718Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Reliable identification of clouds is necessary for any type of optical remote sensing image analysis, especially in operational and fully automatic setups. One of the most elaborated and widespread algorithms, namely Fmask, was initially developed for the Landsat suite of satellites. Despite their similarity, application to Sentinel-2 imagery is currently hampered by the unavailability of a thermal band, and although results can be improved when taking the cirrus band into account, Sentinel-2 cloud detections are unsatisfactory in two points. (1) Low altitude clouds can be undetectable in the cirrus band, and (2) bright land surfaces – especially built-up structures – are often misclassified as clouds when only considering spectral information. In this paper, we present the Cloud Displacement Index (CDI), which makes use of the three highly correlated near infrared bands that are observed with different view angles. Hence, elevated objects like clouds are observed under a parallax and can be reliably separated from bright ground objects. We compare CDI with the currently used cloud probabilities, and propose how to integrate this new functionality into the Fmask algorithm. We validate the approach using test images over metropolitan areas covering a wide variety of global environments and climates, indicating the successful separation of clouds and built-up structures (overall accuracy 95%, i.e. an improvement in overall accuracy of 0.29–0.39 compared to the previous Fmask versions over the 20 test sites), and hence a full compensation for a missing thermal band.","tags":null,"title":"Improvement of the Fmask algorithm for Sentinel-2 images: Separating clouds from bright surfaces based on parallax effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anne Schneibel","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"cd7a832ab40c1c08d6e3f4e22eb7f72b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schneibel-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344823Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schneibel-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Dry tropical forests are facing large-scale conversion and degradation processes and are the most endangered forest type worldwide. We analyse these processes in the dry tropical forest type of miombo woodlands in a rural area of south-central Angola. We show that large-scale conversion to agricultural areas takes place in this area, as does modifi cation of woodland areas, i.e. by degradation due to the extraction of natural resources. By using remote sensing data, spatial drivers of this conversion and its eff ects may be assessed for the time period 1989?2013. We identify settlement dynamics and the location and quality of streets as major underlying determining factors for conversion processes. Since the 1980s, the rate of agricultural expansion has strongly depended on socioeconomic background factors and is currently on a level of ca. 9 000 ha/year in the study area. Fallows were found to only slowly regenerate, and there is a change in cultivation pattern to more permanent forms of cultivation. Large portions of the study area are undergoing degradation processes, leading to an additional loss of biomass. The results indicate that there is high pressure on the natural ecosystems of the study area, which will probably aggravate in the future with a high likelihood of emerging land use confl icts.","tags":null,"title":"Long-term land use change analysis in south-central Angola.

The latter have sometimes needed to focus on small test sites for very specifi c questions, or else required data and methods that allowed large area assessments. In either situation it is important that the studies are founded on consistent and comparable data. Responding to this requirement, a range of products based on operational earth observation satellite systems has been developed in the frame of SASSCAL. Here, we introduce the most relevant primary and derived products at coarse (250?500 m MODIS) and medium (30 m Landsat) spatial resolution, describe their basic properties, and provide examples of application as an impetus for further research. At the same time, alternative sources of data and advances in sensor systems off er high potential in complementing information from operational products, or provide further insights into specifi c local questions. We thus briefl y touch upon the potential of such systems, including active sensing and/or airborne technologies such as Synthetic Aperture Radar, Light Detection and Ranging, use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and hyperspectral imaging, and introduce studies carried under SASSCAL using these systems.","tags":null,"title":"Remote sensing-based environmental assessment and monitoring – generation of operational baseline and enhanced experimental products in southern Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1253e1412c0ff38c1947c80bdf93dfbb","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/sattgruen/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sattgruen/","section":"project","summary":"Role: Associated","tags":["running"],"title":"SattGrün","type":"project"},{"authors":["David Parduhn","David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"775b227190fc27612e9c526495d9cd5d","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/parduhn-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343386Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parduhn-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Zambia has been losing about 250,000 ha of forest annually.

These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming. We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5–8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994–1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailed information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics. We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing.","tags":null,"title":"Assessment of spatio-temporal changes of smallholder cultivation patterns in the Angolan Miombo belt using segmentation of Landsat time series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erik Haß","David Frantz","Sebastian Mader","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"82b1b2ffeb5af9b2f6e6bc583d4d0c4b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/hass-2017/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.342251Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hass-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Image compositing enables the generation of continuous and equidistant time series of vegetation indices (VIs) as a requisite for deriving phenological metrics. This is achieved by selecting a representative choice from available observations within a compositing period. Commonly, phenological processors associate the VI value with a reference date rather than the actual acquisition date. This letter focuses on a global assessment of the resulting temporal discrepancy between the assumed reference date and the actual acquisition date using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-VI day of composite (DOC) information from 2000 to 2015. It is shown that the long-term global mean DOC coincides with the midday of a compositing period (day 8.44 ± 0.44). The global summarized 2-D frequency distributions of succeeding compositing periods revealed that only 16.93% of all occurrences indicate a 16-day difference. The commonly used assumptions that the DOC coincides with the first, mid, or last day of the compositing period on average only hold true for 7.02%, 6.07%, and 6.03% of temporal succeeding compositing periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of 2-D frequency distributions occur as a result of climatic regions and seasonality. A MODIS tile is on average composed of more than 50% DOC combinations, indicating deviations (1-31 days) from the 16-day difference. Since information about the actual acquisition date is available, and methods for the incorporation of irregular data into phenological analysis do exist, it is recommended to incorporate this information into the phenology research based on VI time series to avoid unnecessary uncertainty.","tags":null,"title":"Global Analysis of the Differences Between the MODIS Vegetation Index Compositing Date and the Actual Acquisition Date","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"f75b96314d95a546a141c07fc06a2eee","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2017/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.340585Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The need for operational monitoring of landscape processes on the national to global scale led to an increased demand for pixel-based composites using complete earth observation (EO) archives. Commonly, composites are generated without explicit consideration of temporal criteria but are rather based on optimizing band indices within a pre-defined temporal window. However, for certain applications phenology-adapted composites that represent the land surface as being in the same phenological stage are required, e.g. tree type discrimination where greening up or senescence dates are modified by terrain elevation. We developed a novel pixel-based compositing technique that dynamically adjusts the selection process to the underlying land surface phenology (LSP) of each pixel. By doing so, phenologically sound composites across large areas can be derived for regular intervals and different phenological points in time, e.g. peak, end or minimum of season. Various day-of-year (DOY) scoring functions were implemented to flexibly define the phenological target. The technique is general enough for global application and can be applied to any kind of gridded EO archive, herein demonstrated for MODIS and Landsat data. Multi-annual composites were successfully generated for Zambia for most seasons. As an exception, we found even very frequent MODIS observations to be insufficient for peak vegetation composites due to interference with the rainy season. The phenology-adaptive composites were compared to static ones, i.e. using a single target DOY. Results clearly indicated that biomass levels differ significantly between the techniques, and a phenological normalization across elevation gradients and land cover classes could be achieved. However, the implications are non-trivial and the characteristics of both methods need to be considered cautiously before deciding which approach is superior with regards to a specific thematic application. The quality of the MODIS and Landsat composites, as well as the performance of the phenology-adaptive and static compositing techniques were assured using a quantitative cross-comparison. A 12-year annual time series demonstrated the feasibility for land cover change and modification mapping. Several change processes were clearly discriminable. The resulting phenologically coherent composites are important to establish national, regional or even global landscape monitoring, reporting and verification systems.","tags":null,"title":"Phenology-adaptive pixel-based compositing using optical earth observation imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anne Schneibel","David Frantz","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","Kim Fischer","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"bd9109db67045796cbd0f50821689198","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schneibel-2017b/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344534Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schneibel-2017b/","section":"publication","summary":"Dry tropical forests undergo massive conversion and degradation processes. This also holds true for the extensive Miombo forests that cover large parts of Southern Africa. While the largest proportional area can be found in Angola, the country still struggles with food shortages, insufficient medical and educational supplies, as well as the ongoing reconstruction of infrastructure after 27 years of civil war. Especially in rural areas, the local population is therefore still heavily dependent on the consumption of natural resources, as well as subsistence agriculture. This leads, on one hand, to large areas of Miombo forests being converted for cultivation purposes, but on the other hand, to degradation processes due to the selective use of forest resources. While forest conversion in south-central rural Angola has already been quantitatively described, information about forest degradation is not yet available. This is due to the history of conflicts and the therewith connected research difficulties, as well as the remote location of this area. We apply an annual time series approach using Landsat data in south-central Angola not only to assess the current degradation status of the Miombo forests, but also to derive past developments reaching back to times of armed conflicts. We use the Disturbance Index based on tasseled cap transformation to exclude external influences like inter-annual variation of rainfall. Based on this time series, linear regression is calculated for forest areas unaffected by conversion, but also for the pre-conversion period of those areas that were used for cultivation purposes during the observation time. Metrics derived from linear regression are used to classify the study area according to their dominant modification processes. We compare our results to MODIS latent integral trends and to further products to derive information on underlying drivers. Around 13% of the Miombo forests are affected by degradation processes, especially along streets, in villages, and close to existing agriculture. However, areas in presumably remote and dense forest areas are also affected to a significant extent. A comparison with MODIS derived fire ignition data shows that they are most likely affected by recurring fires and less by selective timber extraction. We confirm that areas that are used for agriculture are more heavily disturbed by selective use beforehand than those that remain unaffected by conversion. The results can be substantiated by the MODIS latent integral trends and we also show that due to extent and location, the assessment of forest conversion is most likely not sufficient to provide good estimates for the loss of natural resources.","tags":null,"title":"Using Annual Landsat Time Series for the Detection of Dry Forest Degradation Processes in South-Central Angola","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill\nPrecision Forestry 2016: Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 21 December 2016, Trier, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1482278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1482278400,"objectID":"449c5089157d5e80299e55439f09472a","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb037/","publishdate":"2016-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb037/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill @ Precision Forestry 2016: Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 21 December 2016, Trier, Germany","tags":["2016"],"title":"Sentinel4GRIPS - Aufbereitung von Satellitenbildarchiven zur Charakterisierung von Waldsystemen","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill\nVeränderungserkennung mittels Fernerkundungsdaten, 8-9 November 2016, Koblenz, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1478563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478563200,"objectID":"105f8a162828193e67ea95aaa03286d7","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb038/","publishdate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb038/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill @ Veränderungserkennung mittels Fernerkundungsdaten, 8-9 November 2016, Koblenz, Germany","tags":["2016"],"title":"Integration von Sentinel-2 Daten in die automatisierte Level-2 Prozessierung von Erdbeobachtungsdaten","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470009600,"objectID":"ba619ecb3ba8309fe3615057d618f8f2","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/sentinel4grips/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sentinel4grips/","section":"project","summary":"Role: Researcher","tags":["completed"],"title":"Sentinel4GRIPS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marion Stellmes, David Frantz, Manfred Finckh, Rasmus Revermann, Achim Röder, Vera De Cauwer, Anne Schneibel, Joachim Hill\nGEO BON 2016 Open Science Conference \u0026amp;

Cloud and cloud shadow detection is performed by a modified Fmask code. Surface reflectance is inferred from Tanré's formulation of the radiative transfer, including adjacency effect correction. A precompiled MODIS water vapor database provides daily or climatological fallback estimates. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is estimated over dark objects (DOs) that are identified in a combined database and image-based approach, where information on their temporal persistency is utilized. AOD is inferred with consideration of the actual target reflectance and background contamination effect. In case of absent DOs in bright scenes, a fallback approach with a modeled AOD climatology is used instead. Topographic normalization is performed by a modified C-correction. The data are projected into a single coordinate system and are organized in a gridded data structure for simplified pixel-based access. We based the assessment of the produced data set on an exhaustive analysis of overlapping pixels: 98.8% of the redundant overlaps are in the range of the expected ±2.5% overall radiometric algorithm accuracy. AOD is in very good agreement with Aerosol Robotic Network sunphotometer data (R 2 : 0.72 to 0.79, low intercepts, and slopes near unity).

Yet, the increase in crop production at the expense of natural resources carries an inherent potential for conflicts since the demand for timber and wood extraction are also supposed to rise. We use the concept of ecosystem services to evaluate the trade-off between food and woody biomass. Our study area is located in central Angola, in the highlands of the upper Okavango catchment. We used Landsat data (spatial resolution: 30 × 30 m) with a bi-temporal and multi-seasonal change detection approach for five time steps between 1989 and 2013 to estimate the conversion area from woodland to agriculture. Overall accuracy is 95%, user's accuracy varies from 89–95% and producer's accuracy ranges between 92–99%. To quantify the trade-off between woody biomass and the amount of food, this information was combined with indicator values and we furthermore assessed biomass regrowth on fallows. Our results reveal a constant rise in agricultural expansion from 1989–2013 with the mean annual deforestation rate increasing from roughly 5300 ha up to about 12,000 ha. Overall, 5.6% of the forested areas were converted to agriculture, whereas the FAO states a national deforestation rate for Angola of 5% from 1990–2010 (FAO, 2010). In the last time step 961,000 t per year of woodland were cleared to potentially produce 1240 t per year of maize. Current global agro-economical projections forecast increasing pressure on tropical dry forests from large-scale agriculture schemes (Gasparri et al., 2015; Searchinger and Heimlich, 2015). Our study underlines the importance of considering subsistence-related change processes, which may contribute significantly to negative effects associated with deforestation and degradation of these forest ecosystems.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating the Trade-Off Between Food and Timber Resulting from the Conversion of Miombo Forests to Agricultural Land in Angola Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Marion Stellmes","Achim Röder","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"24c9ba0d63dc2507ae37c47d1af38fa2","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2016e/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.341693Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2016e/","section":"publication","summary":"Fire spread information on a large scale is still a missing key layer for a complete description of fire regimes.

Despite remote sensing being the only feasible means of monitoring forest change at regional or greater scales, there is no retrospectively available remote sensor that meets the demand of monitoring forests with the required spatial detail and guaranteed high temporal frequency. As an alternative, we employed the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to produce a dense synthetic time series by fusing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) adjusted reflectance. Forest loss was detected by applying a multi-temporal disturbance detection approach implementing a Disturbance Index-based detection strategy. The detection thresholds were permutated with random numbers for the normal distribution in order to generate a multi-dimensional threshold confidence area. As a result, a more robust parameterization and a spatially more coherent detection could be achieved. (i) The original Landsat time series; (ii) synthetic time series; and a (iii) combined hybrid approach were used to identify the timing and extent of disturbances. The identified clearings in the Landsat detection were verified using an annual woodland clearing dataset from Queensland’s Statewide Landcover and Trees Study. Disturbances caused by stand-replacing events were successfully identified. The increased temporal resolution of the synthetic time series indicated promising additional information on disturbance timing. The results of the hybrid detection unified the benefits of both approaches, i.e., the spatial quality and general accuracy of the Landsat detection and the increased temporal information of synthetic time series. Results indicated that a temporal improvement in the detection of the disturbance date could be achieved relative to the irregularly spaced Landsat data for sufficiently large patches.","tags":null,"title":"Forest Disturbance Mapping Using Dense Synthetic Landsat/MODIS Time-Series and Permutation-Based Disturbance Index Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Marion Stellmes","Achim Röder","Thomas Udelhoven","Sebastian Mader","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"fccfb53daefb146d1062713ad083259f","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2016b/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.34197Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2016b/","section":"publication","summary":"Satellite-derived land surface phenology (LSP) serves as a valuable input source for many environmental applications such as land cover classifications and global change studies. Commonly, LSP is derived from coarse-resolution (CR) sensors due to their well-suited temporal resolution. However, LSP is increasingly demanded at medium resolution (MR), but inferring LSP directly from MR imagery remains a challenging task (e.g., due to acquisition frequency). As such, we present a methodology that directly predicts MR LSP on the basis of the respective CR LSP and MR reflectance imagery. The approach considers information from the local pixel neighborhood at both resolutions by utilizing several prediction proxies, including spectral distance and multiscale heterogeneity metrics. The prediction performs well with simulated data (R2=0.84), and the approach substantially reduces noise. The size of the smallest reliably predicted object coincides with the effective CR pixel size (i.e., field-of-view). Nevertheless, even subpixel objects can be reliably predicted provided that pure CR pixels are located within the search radius. The application to real MODIS LSP and Landsat reflectance well preserves the phenological landscape composition, and the spatial refinement is especially striking in heterogeneous agricultural areas, where, for example, the circular shape of center pivot irrigation schemes is successfully restored at MR.","tags":null,"title":"Improving the Spatial Resolution of Land Surface Phenology by Fusing Medium- and Coarse-Resolution Inputs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rasmus Revermann","Manfred Finckh","Marion Stellmes","Ben Strohbach","David Frantz","Jens Oldeland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d170c498342536be809e96bf54033220","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/revermann-2016/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343655Z","relpermalink":"/publication/revermann-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"In many parts of Africa, spatially-explicit information on plant α-diversity, i.e., the number of species in a given area, is missing as baseline information for spatial planning. We present an approach on how to combine vegetation-plot databases and remotely-sensed land surface phenology (LSP) metrics to predict plant α-diversity on a regional scale. We gathered data on plant α-diversity, measured as species density, from 999 vegetation plots sized 20 m × 50 m covering all major vegetation units of the Okavango basin in the countries of Angola, Namibia and Botswana. As predictor variables, we used MODIS LSP metrics averaged over 12 years (250-m spatial resolution) and three topographic attributes calculated from the SRTM digital elevation model. Furthermore, we tested whether additional climatic data could improve predictions. We tested three predictor subsets: (1) remote sensing variables; (2) climatic variables; and (3) all variables combined. We used two statistical modeling approaches, random forests and boosted regression trees, to predict vascular plant α-diversity. The resulting maps showed that the Miombo woodlands of the Angolan Central Plateau featured the highest diversity, and the lowest values were predicted for the thornbush savanna in the Okavango Delta area. Models built on the entire dataset exhibited the best performance followed by climate-only models and remote sensing-only models. However, models including climate data showed artifacts. In spite of lower model performance, models based only on LSP metrics produced the most realistic maps. Furthermore, they revealed local differences in plant diversity of the landscape mosaic that were blurred by homogenous belts as predicted by climate-based models. This study pinpoints the high potential of LSP metrics used in conjunction with biodiversity data derived from vegetation-plot databases to produce spatial information on a regional scale that is urgently needed for basic natural resource management applications.","tags":null,"title":"Linking Land Surface Phenology and Vegetation-Plot Databases to Model Terrestrial Plant α-Diversity of the Okavango Basin","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill\nPrecision Forestry - Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 18 December 2015, Trier, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1450396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1450396800,"objectID":"795a385df521ecee3045d7514c3adbca","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb046/","publishdate":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb046/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill @ Precision Forestry - Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 18 December 2015, Trier, Germany","tags":["2015"],"title":"Die Etablierung automatisierter Prozessierungsumgebungen zur künftigen Nutzung von Sentinel-2 Datenarchiven","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill\nGemeinsame Jahrestagung der Arbeitskreise Fernerkundung (DGfG \u0026amp; DGPF), 24-25 September 2015, Bonn, Germany  oral presentation\n","date":1443052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443052800,"objectID":"d6e5f179e20b0bb9e5096c0089e83868","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb047/","publishdate":"2015-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb047/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill @ 4.

We modified two features of the original Fmask: we dropped the termination criterion for shadow matching, and we appended a darkness filter to counteract false positives in bifidly structured dryland areas. The second step utilizes the scene-by-scene detections of the first step and additional time series of cloud and cloud shadow probabilities. All clear-sky observations of a pixel are used to estimate the probabilities' median and standard deviation. Any observation that deviates more than a multiple of the standard deviation from the median is considered an outlier and thus a remaining cloud or cloud shadow. The method was specifically designed for use in water-limited dryland areas, where event-based precipitation is predominant. As an effect, green vegetation peaks are highly variable, in timing, magnitude, and frequency, with adverse effects on commonly used Fourier-based outlier detection methods.

This requires a full understanding of its components such as fire frequency, fire season and fire intensity. For the Okavango region these components were derived based on an extensive multi-scale compilation of the MODIS products “Active Fire” (AF) and “Burned Area” (BA) covering the period 2001 to 2012. The integrated analysis of these mutually exclusive datasets allowed for a comprehensive characterisation of important descriptors of the large scale fire regime. The descriptive fire parameters are discussed considering dominant land cover classes. These were derived by clustering phenological metrics which were in turn derived by analysing temporally dense MODIS time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).The variation within the study area regarding the overall area affected by fire, the fire frequency as well as the fire seasonality can be explained to a high degree by land cover and local human fire management practises. Thus, Miombo woodlands are less affected by fires than other vegetation communities like for instance thornbush savannahs or grasslands in the river valleys of the upper catchment.We provide a considerable overview of spatial and temporal fire dynamics within the Okavango region. This is an important step in generating the necessary information required to feed into land use management scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Fire Frequency, Fire Seasonality and Fire Intensity within the Okavango Region Derived from MODIS Fire Products","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"M.
