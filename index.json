Building area or building footprint data is particularly required in research related to population, such as disaster risk management or urban health. This study examined the suitability of machine learning regression-based unmixing for quantifying the pixel-wise share of building area with decametre resolution Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Compared to using a single-step approach directly estimating building area, leading to an over-estimation of building area compared to non-building impervious surface area due to feature similarity, the introduction of a hierarchical approach considerably improved mapping results. While the original mapping resolution was 10 m, we found that building area was most accurately mapped starting at a spatial resolution of 100 m – a resolution well suitable for many urban applications. The proposed approach is widely transferable in space as it used spatially robust spectral-temporal metrics from time series imagery and as its requirements for training data are very limited.","tags":null,"title":"Sub-pixel building area mapping based on synthetic training data and regression-based unmixing using Sentinel-1 and -2 data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Georgia Doxani, Eric F.

Multiple methods have been developed to address the problem of cloud detection in satellite imagery and a number of cloud masking algorithms have been developed for optical sensors but very few studies have carried out quantitative intercomparison of state-of-the-art methods in this domain. This paper summarizes results of the first Cloud Masking Intercomparison eXercise (CMIX) conducted within the Committee Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration \u0026 Validation (WGCV). CEOS is the forum for space agency coordination and cooperation on Earth observations, with activities organized under working groups. CMIX, as one such activity, is an international collaborative effort aimed at intercomparing cloud detection algorithms for moderate-spatial resolution (10–30 m) spaceborne optical sensors. The focus of CMIX is on open and free imagery acquired by the Landsat 8 (NASA/USGS) and Sentinel-2 (ESA) missions. Ten algorithms developed by nine teams from fourteen different organizations representing universities, research centers and industry, as well as space agencies (CNES, ESA, DLR, and NASA), are evaluated within the CMIX. Those algorithms vary in their approach and concepts utilized which were based on various spectral properties, spatial and temporal features, as well as machine learning methods. Algorithm outputs are evaluated against existing reference cloud mask datasets. Those datasets vary in sampling methods, geographical distribution, sample unit (points, polygons, full image labels), and generation approaches (experts, machine learning, sky images). Overall, the performance of algorithms varied depending on the reference dataset, which can be attributed to differences in how the reference datasets were produced. The algorithms were in good agreement for thick cloud detection, which were opaque and had lower uncertainties in their identification, in contrast to thin/semi-transparent clouds detection. Not only did CMIX allow identification of strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms and potential areas of improvements, but also the problems associated with the existing reference datasets. The paper concludes with recommendations on generating new reference datasets, metrics, and an analysis framework to be further exploited and additional input datasets to be considered by future CMIX activities.","tags":null,"title":"Cloud Mask Intercomparison eXercise (CMIX): An evaluation of cloud masking algorithms for Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["He Yin","Bin Tan","David Frantz","Volker Radeloff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645056000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645056000,"objectID":"6bb6345155bacc23f9538805c7ca2984","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/yin-2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-17T08:40:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yin-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In mountainous environments, topography strongly affects the reflectance due to illumination effects and cast shadows, which introduce errors in land cover classifications. However, topographic correction is not routinely implemented in standard data pre-processing chains (e.g., Landsat Analysis Ready Data), and there is a lack of consensus whether topographic correction is necessary, and if so, how to conduct it. Furthermore, methods that correct simultaneously for atmospheric and topographic effects are becoming available, but they have not been compared directly. Our objects were to investigate (1) the effectiveness of two topographic correction approaches that integrate atmospheric and topographic correction, (2) improvements in classification accuracy when analyzing topographically corrected single-date imagery (14 July 2016 and 2 October 2016), versus a full Landsat time series from 2014 to 2016, and 3) improvements in classification accuracy when including additional terrain information (i.e. topographic slope, elevation, and aspect). We developed a physical based model and compared it with an enhanced C-correction, both of which integrate atmospheric and topographic correction. We compared classification accuracies with and without topographic correction using combinations of single-date imagery, image composites and spectral-temporal metrics generated from the full Landsat time series, and additional terrain information in the Caucasus Mountains. We found that both the enhanced C-correction and the physical model performed very well and largely eliminated the correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r ranges from 0.06 to 0.24) between surface reflectance and illumination condition, but the physical model performed best (r ranges from 0.05 to 0.11). Both image composites, and spectral-temporal metrics generated from corrected imagery, resulted in significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher classification accuracies and better forest classifications, especially for the mixed forests. Adding terrain information reduced classification error significantly, but not as much as topographic correction. In summary, topographic correction remains necessary, even when analyzing a full Landsat time series and including a digital elevation model in the classification. We recommend that topographic correction should be applied when analyzing Landsat satellite imagery in mountainous region for forest cover classification.","tags":null,"title":"Integrated topographic corrections improve forest mapping using Landsat imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Patrick Hostert","Philippe Rufin","Stefan Ernst","Achim Röder","Sebastian van der Linden"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643155200,"objectID":"7698f0b7d92a91ffd7b9085ccae77a5a","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2022a/","publishdate":"2022-01-26T08:40:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2022a/","section":"publication","summary":"Open and analysis-ready data, as well as methodological and technical advancements have resulted in an unprecedented capability for observing the Earth\u0026rsquo;s land surfaces. Over 10 years ago, Landsat time series analyses were inevitably limited to a few expensive images from carefully selected acquisition dates. Yet, such a static selection may have introduced uncertainties when spatial or inter-annual variability in seasonal vegetation growth were large. As seminal pre-open-data-era papers are still heavily cited, variations of their workflows are still widely used, too. Thus, here we quantitatively assessed the level of agreement between an approach using carefully selected images and a state-of-the-art analysis that uses all available images. We reproduced a representative case study from the year 2003 that for the first time used annual Landsat time series to assess long-term vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem in Crete, Greece. We replicated this assessment using all available data paired with a time series method based on land surface phenology metrics. Results differed fundamentally because the volatile timing of statically selected images relative to the phenological cycle introduced systematic uncertainty. We further applied lessons learned to arrive at a more nuanced and information-enriched vegetation dynamics description by decomposing vegetation cover into woody and herbaceous components, followed by a syndrome-based classification of change and trend parameters. This allowed for a more reliable interpretation of vegetation changes and even permitted us to disentangle certain land-use change processes with opposite trajectories in the vegetation components that were not observable when solely analyzing total vegetation cover. The long-term budget of net cover change revealed that vegetation cover of both components has increased at large and that this process was mainly driven by gradual processes. We conclude that study designs based on static image selection strategies should be critically evaluated in the light of current data availability, analytical capabilities, and with regards to the ecosystem under investigation. We recommend using all available data and taking advantage of phenology-based approaches that remove the selection bias and hence reduce uncertainties in results.","tags":null,"title":"Revisiting the past: Replicability of a historic long-term vegetation dynamics assessment in the era of big data analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcel Schwieder","Maximilian Wesemeyer","David Frantz","Kira Pfoch","Stefan Erasmi","Jürgen Pickert","Claas Nendel","Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637798400,"objectID":"dfd562653c515fb6d703f0ebc5e7c4d9","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schwieder-2022/","publishdate":"2021-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schwieder-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatially explicit knowledge on grassland extent and management is critical to understand and monitor the impact of grassland use intensity on ecosystem services and biodiversity. While regional studies allow detailed insights into land use and ecosystem service interactions, information on a national scale can aid biodiversity assessments. However, for most European countries this information is not yet widely available. We used an analysis-ready-data cube that contains dense time series of co-registered Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, covering the extent of Germany. We propose an algorithm that detects mowing events in the time series based on residuals from an assumed undisturbed phenology, as an indicator of grassland use intensity. A self-adaptive ruleset enabled to account for regional variations in land surface phenology and non-stationary time series on a pixel-basis. We mapped mowing events for the years from 2017 to 2020 for permanent grassland areas in Germany. The results were validated on a pixel level in four of the main natural regions in Germany based on reported mowing events for a total of 92 (2018) and 78 (2019) grassland parcels. Results for 2020 were evaluated with combined time series of Landsat, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope data. The mean absolute percentage error between detected and reported mowing events was on average 40% (2018), 36% (2019) and 35% (2020). Mowing events were on average detected 11 days (2018), 7 days (2019) and 6 days (2020) after the reported mowing. Performance measures varied between the different regions of Germany, and lower accuracies were found in areas that are revisited less frequently by Sentinel-2. Thus, we assessed the influence of data availability and found that the detection of mowing events was less influenced by data availability when at least 16 cloud-free observations were available in the grassland season. Still, the distribution of available observations throughout the season appeared to be critical. On a national scale our results revealed overall higher shares of less intensively mown grasslands and smaller shares of highly intensively managed grasslands. Hotspots of the latter were identified in the alpine foreland in Southern Germany as well as in the lowlands in the Northwest of Germany. While these patterns were stable throughout the years, the results revealed a tendency to lower management intensity in the extremely dry year 2018. Our results emphasize the ability of the approach to map the intensity of grassland management throughout large areas despite variations in data availability and environmental conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping grassland mowing events across Germany based on combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabian Lehmann","David Frantz","Sören Becker","Ulf Leser","Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"fbafeabdfcc329b2e49638259bfddf3d","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/lehmann_2021/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lehmann_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern Earth Observation (EO) often analyses hundreds of gigabytes of data from thousands of satellite images. This data usually is processed with hand-made scripts combining several tools implementing the various steps within such an analysis. In such a setting, a fair amount of geographers’ work goes into optimization, tuning and, parallelization. Development becomes even more complicated when compute clusters become necessary, introducing issues like scheduling, remote data access, and generally a greatly increased infrastructure complexity. Furthermore, tailor-made systems are often optimized to one specific system and cannot easily be adapted to other infrastructures. Data Analysis Workflow engines promise to relieve the workflow developer from finding custom solutions to these issues and thereby improve scalability, reproducibility, and reusability of workflows while reducing development cost at the infrastructure side. On the other hand, they require the workflow to be programmed in a particular language, to obey certain principles of distributed processing, and to properly configure and tune the execution stack, which puts additional burden to data scientists. Here, we study this trade-off using a concrete EO workflow for long-term vegetation dynamics in the Mediterranean. The original workflow was programmed with FORCE, a custom-made framework for assembling and executing EO workflows on stand-alone servers. We ported it to the scientific workflow system Nextflow, which is capable of seamlessly orchestrating workflows over a large variety of infrastructures. We discuss the pitfalls we faced while porting the workflow, advantages and disadvantages of such an approach, and compare in detail the efficiency of both implementations on various infrastructures. We quantify the overhead in execution time incurred by the workflow engine and give hints on how to deal with heterogeneous tasks.

However, we still lack a better understanding on both whether multi-season hyperspectral approaches are favorable over single-season approaches, as well as on the benefits of hyperspectral compared to multispectral data. Our study investigates the potential of multi-season unmixing of simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data for vegetation class fraction mapping across diverse natural and semi-natural ecoregions in California, USA. We utilized spring, summer and fall 2013 simulated EnMAP imagery derived from Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data covering study sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, Lake Tahoe and Santa Barbara. Regression-based unmixing with synthetic training datasets from spectral libraries was implemented for mapping needleleaf tree, broadleaf tree, shrub, herbaceous and non-vegetation fractions, and independent reference data was used for validation. Multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP had average Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) over all classes of 8.7% for the Bay Area, 8.5% for Lake Tahoe and 9.6% for Santa Barbara. However, larger errors in the low and high end of the fraction range remained, particularly in open-canopy woodlands and xeric shrub-dominated regions. Single-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP revealed large seasonal and regional variations within individual vegetation classes. In most cases, the best performing single-season unmixing had similar errors as the multi-season unmixing, i.e., ∆MAEs within ±1.0%. This points to the advantage of the multi-season integration strategy for more robust and generalized mapping independent from season and study site. Relative to EnMAP analyses, multi-season unmixing of multispectral Landsat composites for the same seasons yielded increases in average MAEs of +1.7%, +2.3% and +1.4% for the three study sites. This indicates that the higher spectral resolution of simulated EnMAP provides more relevant discriminative information when comparing contemporary image pairs. Unmixing of seasonal spectral-temporal metrics (STMs) from all available Landsat images for an entire year took advantage of the full temporal detail provided by these ongoing missions. We found Landsat STMs to effectively map vegetation class fractions, with average MAEs of 9.9%, 10.0% and 9.7% for the three study sites. Still, improvements particularly for mapping fractions of the woody vegetation classes through multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP point to the benefit of high spectral resolution data, and we assume that a comparable higher temporal resolution of hyperspectral satellites will further positively influence results. Overall, we conclude that multi-season unmixing of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data holds great potential for advancing vegetation class fraction mapping across natural and semi-natural ecosystems.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-season unmixing of vegetation class fractions across diverse Californian ecoregions using simulated spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Franz Schug, David Frantz, Dominik Wiedenhofer, Doris Virág, André Baumgart, Helmut Haberl, Patrick Hostert\nInternational Industrial Ecology Day 2021, 21 June, Online\noral presentation\n","date":1622073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622073600,"objectID":"8693c3816de52a4adbe12386e269ea1b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/schug-2021b/","publishdate":"2021-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/schug-2021b/","section":"presentation","summary":"Franz Schug, David Frantz, Dominik Wiedenhofer, Doris Virág, André Baumgart, Helmut Haberl, Patrick Hostert @ International Industrial Ecology Day 2021, 21 June, Online","tags":["2021"],"title":"Why using High-Resolution Earth Observation imagery for National-Scale Bottom-Up Estimation of Material Stocks?","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz\nRemote Sensing Lecture Day, Eidgenössischen Forschungsanstalt für Wald, Schnee und Landschaft (WSL), 2 June 2021, Online\npresentation (+demonstration?)\n","date":1619654400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619654400,"objectID":"12bcfeaa6ea86a951e10aa0d516a240c","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/frantz-2021d/","publishdate":"2021-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/frantz-2021d/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz @ Remote Sensing Lecture Day, Eidgenössischen Forschungsanstalt für Wald, Schnee und Landschaft (WSL), 2 June 2021, Online","tags":["2021"],"title":"FORCE - from large-scale EO data to information.

Operational coregistration of Sentinel-2A and -2B imagery is thus required. We present a modification of the established Landsat Sentinel Registration (LSReg) algorithm. The modifications enabled LSReg to be included in an operational preprocessing workflow to automatically coregister large volumes of Sentinel-2 imagery with Landsat base images that represent multiannual monthly spectral average values. The modified LSReg was tested for the complete Sentinel-2 archive covering Crete, Greece, which is a particularly challenging region due to steep topographic gradients and high shares of water in Sentinel-2 tiles. A coregistration success rate of 87.5% of all images was obtained with a mean coregistration precision of 4.4 m. The mean shifts of 14.0 m in the x-direction and 13.4 m in the y-direction before coregistration were found, with maxima exceeding four pixels. Time series noise in locations with land cover transitions (n = 585) was effectively reduced by 43% using the presented approach. The multitemporal geometric consistency of the Sentinel-2 data set was substantially improved, thus enabling time series analyses within the Sentinel-2 data record, as well as integrated Landsat and Sentinel-2A and -2B data sets. The modified algorithm is implemented in the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE) version 3.0 (https://github.com/davidfrantz/force).","tags":null,"title":"Operational Coregistration of the Sentinel-2A/B Image Archive Using Multitemporal Landsat Spectral Averages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franz Schug","David Frantz","Sebastian van der Linden","Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"61fa874e8912e272598cd47553789c1a","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schug-2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schug-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Gridded population data is widely used to map fine scale population patterns and dynamics to understand associated human-environmental processes for global change research, disaster risk assessment and other domains.

We first produced and validated a nation-wide dataset of predominant residential and non-residential building types. We then examined the impact of different weighting layers from density, type and height on top-down dasymetric mapping quality across scales. We finally performed a nation-wide bottom-up population estimate based on the three datasets. We found that integrating building types into dasymetric mapping is helpful at fine scale, as population is not redistributed to non-residential areas. Building density improved the overall quality of population estimates at all scales compared to using a binary building layer. Most importantly, we found that the combined use of density and height, i.e. volume, considerably increased mapping quality in general and with regard to regional discrepancy by largely eliminating systematic underestimation in dense agglomerations and overestimation in rural areas. We also found that building density, type and volume, together with living floor area per capita, are suitable to produce accurate large-area bottom-up population estimates.","tags":null,"title":"Gridded population mapping for Germany based on building density, height and type from Earth Observation data using census disaggregation and bottom-up estimates","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Dominik Wiedenhofer, Doris Virág, Franz Schug, David Frantz, Sebastian van der Linden, Patrick Hostert, Helmut Haberl\nEcoBalance 2020, 25 Februrary - 5 March 2021, Sendai, Japan (Online)\noral presentation\n","date":1614255300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614255300,"objectID":"702ba99e4ab67e3963b4605fbc5e1507","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/wiedenhofer-2020/","publishdate":"2021-02-25T12:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/wiedenhofer-2020/","section":"presentation","summary":"Dominik Wiedenhofer, Doris Virág, Franz Schug, David Frantz, Sebastian van der Linden, Patrick Hostert, Helmut Haberl @ EcoBalance 2020, 25 Februrary - 5 March 2021, Sendai, Japan (Online)","tags":["2021"],"title":"A novel approach for mapping material stocks of buildings and infrastructure from remote-sensing data at the national scale and beyond","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz\nCopernicus Data and Exploitation Platform - DE (CODE-DE) - Online Schulung \u0026ldquo;Vordefinierte Prozessoren\u0026rdquo;, 25 February 2021, Online\npresentation\n","date":1614211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614211200,"objectID":"933a01a83cc388a58da6c6d1baf2b3c4","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/frantz-2021e/","publishdate":"2021-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/frantz-2021e/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz @ Copernicus Data and Exploitation Platform - DE (CODE-DE) - Online Schulung 'Vordefinierte Prozessoren', 25 February 2021, Online","tags":["2021"],"title":"Atmosphärenkorrektur von Landsat und Sentinel-2 Daten mit FORCE","type":"presentation"},{"authors":["Helmut Haberl","Dominik Wiedenhofer","Franz Schug","David Frantz","Doris Virág","Christoph Plutzar","Karin Gruhler","Jakob Lederer","Georg Schiller","Tomer Fishman","Maud Lanau","Andreas Gattringer","Thomas Kemper","Gang Liu","Hiroki Tanikawa","Sebastian van der Linden","Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614124800,"objectID":"2d13a0f62620306d8e3b47fd45762750","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/haberl-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haberl-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The dynamics of societal material stocks such as buildings and infrastructures and their spatial patterns drive surging resource use and emissions. Two main types of data are currently used to map stocks, night-time lights (NTL) from Earth-observing (EO) satellites and cadastral information. We present an alternative approach for broad-scale material stock mapping based on freely available high-resolution EO imagery and OpenStreetMap data. Maps of built-up surface area, building height, and building types were derived from optical Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 satellite data to map patterns of material stocks for Austria and Germany. Using material intensity factors, we calculated the mass of different types of buildings and infrastructures, distinguishing eight types of materials, at 10 m spatial resolution. The total mass of buildings and infrastructures in 2018 amounted to ~5 Gt in Austria and ~38 Gt in Germany (AT: ~540 t/cap, DE: ~450 t/cap). Cross-checks with independent data sources at various scales suggested that the method may yield more complete results than other data sources but could not rule out possible overestimations. The method yields thematic differentiations not possible with NTL, avoids the use of costly cadastral data, and is suitable for mapping larger areas and tracing trends over time.","tags":null,"title":"High-Resolution Maps of Material Stocks in Buildings and Infrastructures in Austria and Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Supplement to:\nH.

We compare the performance of the masking provided by Fmask (“Function of mask” implemented in FORCE), ATCOR (“Atmospheric Correction”) and Sen2Cor (“Sentinel-2 Correction”) on a set of 20 Sentinel-2 scenes distributed over the globe covering a wide variety of environments and climates. All three methods use rules based on physical properties (Top of Atmosphere Reflectance, TOA) to separate clear pixels from potential cloud pixels, but they use different rules and class-specific thresholds. The methods can yield different results because of different definitions of the dilation buffer size for the classes cloud, cloud shadow and snow. Classification results are compared to the assessment of an expert human interpreter using at least 50 polygons per class randomly selected for each image. The class assignment of the human interpreter is considered as reference or “truth”. The interpreter carefully assigned a class label based on the visual assessment of the true color and infrared false color images and additionally on the bottom of atmosphere (BOA) reflectance spectra. The most important part of the comparison is done for the difference area of the three classifications considered. This is the part of the classification images where the results of Fmask, ATCOR and Sen2Cor disagree. Results on difference area have the advantage to show more clearly the strengths and weaknesses of a classification than results on the complete image. The overall accuracy of Fmask, ATCOR, and Sen2Cor for difference areas of the selected scenes is 45%, 56%, and 62%, respectively. User and producer accuracies are strongly class- and scene-dependent, typically varying between 30% and 90%. Comparison of the difference area is complemented by looking for the results in the area where all three classifications give the same result. Overall accuracy for that “same area” is 97% resulting in the complete classification in overall accuracy of 89%, 91% and 92% for Fmask, ATCOR and Sen2Cor respectively.","tags":null,"title":"Comparison of Masking Algorithms for Sentinel-2 Imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Franz Schug","Akpona Okujeni","Claudio Navacchi","Wolfgang Wagner","Sebastian van der Linden","Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"bbb143b2ea91cc34cda61aae33f62bce","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T08:40:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Urban areas and their vertical characteristics have a manifold and far-reaching impact on our environment. However, openly accessible information at high spatial resolution is still missing at large for complete countries or regions. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B time series to map building heights for entire Germany on a 10 m grid resolving built-up structures in rural and urban contexts. We utilized information from the spectral / polarization, temporal and spatial dimensions by combining band-wise temporal aggregation statistics with morphological metrics. We trained machine learning regression models with highly accurate building height information from several 3D building models. The novelty of this method lies in the very fine resolution yet large spatial extent to which it can be applied, as well as in the use of building shadows in optical imagery. Results indicate that both radar-only and optical-only models can be used to predict building height, but the synergistic combination of both data sources leads to superior results. When testing the model against independent datasets, very consistent performance was achieved (frequency-weighted RMSE of 2.9 m to 3.5 m), which suggests that the prediction of the most frequently occurring buildings was robust.

High temporal and spectral resolution remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 mission enables the derivation of accurate and timely maps of tree species in forests in a cost-efficient way. However, there is still a lack of studies regarding forest stand species mapping for large areas like the Polish Carpathian Mountains (approx. 20,000 km2). In this study, we aimed to develop a workflow to obtain forest stand species maps with machine learning algorithms applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 products and environmental data at regional scale. Using variable importance techniques - Variable Importance Using Random Forests (VSURF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) - we assessed three Sentinel-2 Best Available Pixel composites (April, July and October), eight annual spectral-temporal metrics (STM; mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range, first quartile, third quartile and interquartile range), and four environmental topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, distance to water bodies), i.e. 114 variables in total. Following a variable importance assessment, we produced maps of eleven tree species with the use of three Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) on nine different variable subsets, i.e. in total 27 classifications. The results showed that SVM outperformed the other two classifiers - the highest overall accuracy exceeded 85% for SVM classification of all variables (86.9%), and 64 variables (85.6%). Including elevation information improved the accuracies. From the best five classifications we created a final ensemble map (overall accuracy of 86.6%) and a precision map based on the Simpson Index, which indicates where the five models agree. This ensemble approach allowed us to determine that the lowest precision occurred in foothills and basins with lower forest cover, in the areas with lack of good quality imagery, and at the borders of stands with homogenous species composition. On the other hand, the highest precision occurred in regions with homogenous stands with high forest and canopy cover. The study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data in mapping forest stand species in large mountainous areas with high accuracy. Furthermore, it demonstrates the usefulness of the ensemble approach, which enables to assess the classification precision.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for forest stand species mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery and environmental data in the Polish Carpathians","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599609600,"objectID":"79b62aa08a4ab8c37f22ef6f711c681a","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/tutorials/force-stm/stm/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutorials/force-stm/stm/","section":"tutorials","summary":"This tutorial explains what Spectral Temporal Metrics are, and how to generate them using the Time Series Analysis (TSA) submodule of the FORCE Higher Level Processing system (HLPS).

Given the importance of mountainous regions for ecosystem services and endemic biodiversity, monitoring these changes is essential. Satellite data provide a great resource to map land-cover change in mountainous regions, however mapping is especially challenging there because topographic complexity affects reflectance. The so-called ‘topographic effect’ has been successfully corrected for in case studies of small areas, but a comparison of large-area classifications and land-cover change analyses with and without topographic correction is missing. Here, we performed a long-term land-cover change assessment for a large mountainous region, i.e., the Caucasus Mountains with topographic correction. Our two goals were 1) to examine the effect of topographic correction on land-cover classification for a large mountainous region, and 2) to assess land-cover changes since 1987 across the Caucasus based on the full Landsat archive. Both the complex topography and the history of land-use changes, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, make the Caucasus Mountains an ideal study area to understand topographic effects on large-area land-cover mapping for the last three decades. First, we compared a non-topographically-corrected Landsat classification for 2015 with a classification that was topographically-corrected with an enhanced C-correction for the same year and assessed the accuracy of both. Second, we derived topographically-corrected Landsat classifications for six dates to assess changes in cropland and forest from 1987 to 2015, based on class probabilities and post-classification comparisons. In regard to our first goal, topographic correction improved the overall accuracy of the classification only by 2% (from 79 to 81%), but disagreement rates were as high as 100% in mountainous regions, especially among forest types. In regard to our second goal, we found that cropland loss was the most prevalent change process since 1987. Cropland loss was particularly widespread in Georgia and Armenia until 2000, and in Azerbaijan until 2005. The North Caucasus (the Russian Federation) had more stable cropland over time, most likely due to different land reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the prevalence of flat landscapes and very fertile soils, which make cultivation easier than in the South Caucasus. Rates of forest change throughout the Caucasus Mountains were surprisingly low, with forest loss and forest gain being roughly equal. Forest loss was most likely related to both illegal logging and natural disturbance, whereas forest gain was most likely due to cropland abandonment and less grazing pressure. Our results highlight both the importance and the feasibility of topographic correction for accurate large-area land-cover classifications in steep terrain.","tags":null,"title":"Land-cover change in the Caucasus Mountains since 1987 based on the topographic correction of multi-temporal Landsat composites","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"c1524da77bafbbcb5bbdef651315d3d1","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/fonda/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fonda/","section":"project","summary":"Role: PostDoc","tags":["running"],"title":"FONDA","type":"project"},{"authors":["Franz Schug","David Frantz","Akpona Okujeni","Sebastian van der Linden","Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589155200,"objectID":"919bc803695c3dfdd2e2a3b4e5515753","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schug-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schug-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The increasing impact of humans on land and ongoing global population growth requires an improved understanding of land cover (LC) and land use (LU) processes related to settlements.

Using data provided by different sensors can greatly improve the temporal resolution of time series, fill data gaps and thus improve the quality of land cover monitoring applications. However, multi-sensor approaches are often adversely affected by different spectral characteristics of the sensing instruments, leading to inconsistencies in downstream products. Spectral harmonization, i.e., the transformation of one sensor into the spectral domain of another sensor, may reduce these inconsistencies. It simplifies workflows, increases the reliability of subsequently derived multi-sensor products and may also enable the generation of new products that are not possible with the initial spectral definition. In this paper, we compare the effect of multivariate spectral harmonization techniques on the inter-sensor reflectance consistency and derived products such as spectral indices or land cover classifications. We simulated surface reflectance data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A from airborne hyperspectral data to eliminate any sources of error originating from unequal acquisition geometries, illumination or atmospheric state. We evaluate different methods based on linear, quadratic and random forest regression as well as linear interpolation, and predict not only matching but also unilaterally missing bands (red edge). We additionally consider material-dependent spectral characteristics in the harmonization process by using separate transformation functions for spectral clusters of the input dataset. Our results suggest that spectral harmonization is useful to improve multi-sensor consistency of remote sensing data and subsequently derived products, especially if multiple transformation functions are incorporated. There is a strong dependency between harmonization performance and the similarity of source and target sensor's spectral characteristics. For spectrally transforming Landsat-8 to Sentinel-2A, we achieved the lowest radiometric inter-sensor deviations with 50 spectral clusters and linear regression. Based on simulated data, deviations are below 1.7% reflectance within the red edge spectral region and below 0.3% reflectance for the remaining bands (RMSE). Regarding spectral indices, our results show a reduction of inter-sensor deviation (vegetation pixels only) to 38% of the initial error for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and to 43% for EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). Furthermore, we computed the REIP (Red Edge Inflection Point) with an accuracy of 3.1 nm from Sentinel-2 adapted Landsat-8 data. An exemplary multispectral classification use case revealed an increasing inter-sensor consistency of classification results from 92.3% to 97.3% mean error. Applied to time series of real Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data, we observed similar trends, albeit intermingled with non-sensor-induced inconsistencies.","tags":null,"title":"Spectral harmonization and red edge prediction of Landsat-8 to Sentinel-2 using land cover optimized multivariate regressors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marcel Schwieder, David Frantz, David Loibl, Kira Pfoch, Patrick Hostert\nWissenschaftlich-Technische Jahrestagung der DGPF, 4-6 March 2020, Stuttgart, Germany  oral presentation\n","date":1583280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583280000,"objectID":"ad65d58363c29d29bf55cb303871a274","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/schwieder-2020a/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/schwieder-2020a/","section":"presentation","summary":"Marcel Schwieder, David Frantz, David Loibl, Kira Pfoch, Patrick Hostert @ 40.

The EO Time Series Viewer (i) combines advantages of spatial, spectral and temporal data visualization concepts that are so far not available in a single tool, (ii) provides maximum flexibility in terms of supported data formats, (iii) minimizes the user-interactions required to load and visualize multi-sensor TS data and (iv) speeds-up labeling of TS data based on enhanced GIS vector tools and formats.","tags":null,"title":"Visualizing and labeling dense multi-sensor earth observation time series: The EO Time Series Viewer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576454400,"objectID":"dbabc28985b2e931cea261a3150e87e2","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/tutorials/force-wvdb/wvdb/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutorials/force-wvdb/wvdb/","section":"tutorials","summary":"This tutorial will show how to prepare the Water Vapor Database (WVDB) for the FORCE Level 2 Processing System (FORCE L2PS).","tags":["2019","FORCE","Lower Level","Tutorial"],"title":"FORCE Tutorial: Water Vapor Database","type":"tutorials"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576368000,"objectID":"ced481cb003024700cd60be01377b629","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/code/force/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/code/force/","section":"code","summary":"... is an all-in-one solution for the mass-processing and analysis of medium-resolution satellite image archives for large area + time series applications.","tags":["C/C++","Linux","Open Source","GPL \u003e= 3.0","Earth Observation","Big Data","Large Area","Landsat","Sentinel-2","Sentinel-1","Analysis Ready Data","highly Analysis Ready Data","highly Analysis Ready Data plus","Virtual Constellation","Data harmonization","Level 2 processing","Level 3 processing","Level 4 processing","Atmospheric correction","Topographic correction","NBAR correction","Adjacency effect correction","Cloud detection","Quality Screened Time Series","Resolution merging","Time Series Analysis","Spectral Temporal Metrics","Best Available Pixel composites","Time Series interpolation","Change and Trend analyses","Land Surface Phenology","Clear Sky Observations","Data fusion","Machine Learning"],"title":"FORCE","type":"code"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marcel Schwieder, David Frantz, Kira Pfoch, Patrick Hostert\nNeue Perspektiven der Erdbeobachtung - 2.

The freely available software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring) is capable of generating Landsat ARD. An essential step of generating ARD is atmospheric correction, which requires water vapor data. FORCE relies on a water vapor database obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, two major drawbacks arise from this strategy: (1) The database has to be compiled for each study area prior to generating ARD; and (2) MODIS and Landsat commissioning dates are not well aligned. We have therefore compiled an application-ready global water vapor database to significantly increase the operational readiness of ARD production. The free dataset comprises daily water vapor data for February 2000 to July 2018 as well as a monthly climatology that is used if no daily value is available. We systematically assessed the impact of using this climatology on surface reflectance outputs. A global random sample of Landsat 5/7/8 imagery was processed twice (i) using daily water vapor (reference) and (ii) using the climatology (estimate), followed by computing accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (APU) metrics. All APU measures were well below specification, thus the fallback usage of the climatology is generally a sound strategy. Still, the tests revealed that some considerations need to be taken into account to help quantify which sensor, band, climate, and season are most or least affected by using a fallback climatology. The highest uncertainty and bias is found for Landsat 5, with progressive improvements towards newer sensors. The bias increases from dry to humid climates, whereas uncertainty increases from dry and tropic to temperate climates. Uncertainty is smallest during seasons with low variability, and is highest when atmospheric conditions progress from a dry to a wet season (and vice versa).","tags":null,"title":"A Global MODIS Water Vapor Database for the Operational Atmospheric Correction of Historic and Recent Landsat Imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"72fdb55c0ec41767126ca36431a4729b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2019a/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.339432Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2019a/","section":"publication","summary":"Ever increasing data volumes of satellite constellations call for multi-sensor analysis ready data (ARD) that relieve users from the burden of all costly preprocessing steps. This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an ‘all-in-one’ solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyond ARD specification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided. Outputs of this module can be directly ingested into a geographic information system (GIS) to fuel research questions without any further processing, i.e., hARD+.

However, estimating their separate and combined effects remains a research challenge. In South Africa, streamflow dynamics are important not only for irrigated agriculture but also for many rural communities that depend on streamflow for domestic water supply. In this paper, we analysed the effects of pine, wattle and eucalyptus plantation cover change vis-à-vis the effects of inter-annual climate variability on streamflow dynamics of the Upper Umvoti River in South Africa from 1994 to 2016. We modelled inter-annual variability in streamflow by precipitation, temperature and plantation cover using the Bayesian inference. We mapped plantation cover from Landsat satellite imagery. We found strong evidence for an interaction between temperature range and plantation cover net change on streamflow. Specifically, the plantation effect weakened under conditions of high-temperature range anomalies. We explain this interaction with a shift in soil water repellency and interception capacity within the plantation area under a changing temperature range, with important implications for the formation of surface runoff. Previous studies have assumed that the effects of climate variability and plantation cover change on streamflow dynamics are independent. Our results call this assumption into question. Hence, climate and land cover interdependencies should be accounted for in future statistical and process-based modelling studies.","tags":null,"title":"Interdependent effects of climate variability and forest cover change on streamflow dynamics: a case study in the Upper Umvoti River Basin, South Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philippe Rufin","David Frantz","Stefan Ernst","Andreas Rabe","Patrick Griffiths","Mutlu Özdoğan","Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b9185977fa16f9097862fb096c047747","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/rufin-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344237Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rufin-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatially explicit information on cropland use intensity is vital for monitoring land and water resource demands in agricultural systems. Cropping practices underlie substantial spatial and temporal variability, which can be captured through the analysis of image time series. Temporal binning helps to overcome limitations concerning operability and repeatability for mapping large areas and can improve the thematic detail and consistency of maps in agricultural systems. We here assessed the use of annual, quarterly, and eight-day temporal features for mapping five cropping practices on annual croplands across Turkey. We used 2403 atmospherically corrected and topographically normalized Landsat Collection 1 L1TP images of 2015 to compute quarterly best-pixel composites, quarterly and annual spectral-temporal metrics, as well as gap-filled eight-day time series of Tasseled Cap components. We tested 22 feature sets for binary cropland mapping, and subsequent discrimination of five cropping practices: Spring and winter cropping, summer cropping, semi-aquatic cropping, double cropping, and greenhouse cultivation. We evaluated area-adjusted accuracies and compared cropland area estimates at the province-level with official statistics. We achieved overall accuracies above 90%, when using either all quarterly features or the eight-day Tasseled Cap time series, indicating that temporal binning of intra-annual image time-series into multiple temporal features improves representations of cropping practices. Class accuracies of winter and spring, summer, and double cropping were robust, while omission errors for semi-aquatic cropping and greenhouse cultivation were high. Our mapped cropland extent was in good agreement with province-level statistics (r2 = 0.85, RMSE = 7.2%). Our results indicate that 71.3% (±2.3%) of Turkey’s annual croplands were cultivated during winter and spring, 15.8% (±2.2%) during summer, while 8.5% (±1.6%) were double-cropped, 4% (±1.9%) were cultivated under semi-aquatic conditions, and 0.32% (±0.2%) was greenhouse cultivation. Our study presents an open and readily available framework for detailed cropland mapping over large areas, which bears the potential to inform assessments of land use intensity, as well as land and water resource demands.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping Cropping Practices on a National Scale Using Intra-Annual Landsat Time Series Binning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha Nink","Joachim Hill","Johannes Stoffels","Henning Buddenbaum","David Frantz","Joachim Langshausen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3d61f1a6c30d596b4343b5b9b9ed1ec8","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/nink-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343108Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nink-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"From global monitoring to regional forest management there is an increasing demand for information about forest ecosystems. For border regions that are closely connected ecologically and economically, a key factor is the cross-border availability and consistency of up-to-date information such as the forest type. The combination of existing forest information with Earth observation data is a rational method and can provide valuable contribution to serve the increased information demand on a transnational level. We present an approach for the remote sensing-based generation of a transnational and temporally consistent forest type information layer for the German federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Existing forest information data from different countries were merged and combined with suitable vegetation indices derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery acquired in early spring. An automated bootstrap-based approximation of the optimum threshold for the distinction of “broadleaved” and “coniferous” forest was applied. The spatially explicit forest type information layer is updated annually depending on image availability. Overall accuracies between 79 and 96 percent were obtained. Every spot in the region will be updated successively within a period of expectably three years. The presented approach can be integrated in fully automated processing chains to generate basic forest type information layers on a regular basis.","tags":null,"title":"Using Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data for the Generation of Continuously Updated Forest Type Information Layers in a Cross-Border Region","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Supplement to: Frantz, David; Röder, Achim; Stellmes, Marion; Hill, Joachim (2016): An operational radiometric Landsat preprocessing framework for large-area time series applications.

In this paper, the general ACIX framework is discussed; special mention is made of the motivation to initiate the experiment, the inter-comparison protocol, and the principal results. ACIX is free and open and every developer was welcome to participate. Eventually, 12 participants applied their approaches to various Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 image datasets acquired over sites around the world. The current results diverge depending on the sensors, products, and sites, indicating their strengths and weaknesses.

Our study in NE Namibia and SW Zambia evaluated the potential of operational earth observation satellites to characterize land-use change processes and quantifi ed their impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient concentrations. We found that the area under agricultural use increased by 24% from 2002 to 2013, mainly at the expense of natural vegetation (i.e., woodland). This conversion caused a decline in SOC and total N and tended to increase plantavailable P in the soils of old agricultural fi elds. The eff ects were most pronounced in NE Namibia, where the total SOC stocks were 19.6% (±18.4 SD) lower in agricultural land compared to woodland. Moreover, the losses in SOC and total N tended to result in a decline of predicted maize yields calculated with the QUEFTS model by ~15% when comparing soils of old agricultural fi elds and woodland. Overall, our results indicate that long-term continuation of low-input arable farming can reduce soil fertility.","tags":null,"title":"Deforestation for agricultural expansion in SW Zambia and NE Namibia and the impacts on soil fertility, soil organic carbon- and nutrient levels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Erik Haß","Andreas Uhl","Johannes Stoffels","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5097d022590d777c86fa9ab28320de1e","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.339718Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Reliable identification of clouds is necessary for any type of optical remote sensing image analysis, especially in operational and fully automatic setups. One of the most elaborated and widespread algorithms, namely Fmask, was initially developed for the Landsat suite of satellites. Despite their similarity, application to Sentinel-2 imagery is currently hampered by the unavailability of a thermal band, and although results can be improved when taking the cirrus band into account, Sentinel-2 cloud detections are unsatisfactory in two points. (1) Low altitude clouds can be undetectable in the cirrus band, and (2) bright land surfaces – especially built-up structures – are often misclassified as clouds when only considering spectral information. In this paper, we present the Cloud Displacement Index (CDI), which makes use of the three highly correlated near infrared bands that are observed with different view angles. Hence, elevated objects like clouds are observed under a parallax and can be reliably separated from bright ground objects. We compare CDI with the currently used cloud probabilities, and propose how to integrate this new functionality into the Fmask algorithm. We validate the approach using test images over metropolitan areas covering a wide variety of global environments and climates, indicating the successful separation of clouds and built-up structures (overall accuracy 95%, i.e. an improvement in overall accuracy of 0.29–0.39 compared to the previous Fmask versions over the 20 test sites), and hence a full compensation for a missing thermal band.","tags":null,"title":"Improvement of the Fmask algorithm for Sentinel-2 images: Separating clouds from bright surfaces based on parallax effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anne Schneibel","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"cd7a832ab40c1c08d6e3f4e22eb7f72b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schneibel-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344823Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schneibel-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Dry tropical forests are facing large-scale conversion and degradation processes and are the most endangered forest type worldwide. We analyse these processes in the dry tropical forest type of miombo woodlands in a rural area of south-central Angola. We show that large-scale conversion to agricultural areas takes place in this area, as does modifi cation of woodland areas, i.e. by degradation due to the extraction of natural resources. By using remote sensing data, spatial drivers of this conversion and its eff ects may be assessed for the time period 1989?2013. We identify settlement dynamics and the location and quality of streets as major underlying determining factors for conversion processes. Since the 1980s, the rate of agricultural expansion has strongly depended on socioeconomic background factors and is currently on a level of ca. 9 000 ha/year in the study area. Fallows were found to only slowly regenerate, and there is a change in cultivation pattern to more permanent forms of cultivation.

The latter have sometimes needed to focus on small test sites for very specifi c questions, or else required data and methods that allowed large area assessments. In either situation it is important that the studies are founded on consistent and comparable data. Responding to this requirement, a range of products based on operational earth observation satellite systems has been developed in the frame of SASSCAL. Here, we introduce the most relevant primary and derived products at coarse (250?500 m MODIS) and medium (30 m Landsat) spatial resolution, describe their basic properties, and provide examples of application as an impetus for further research. At the same time, alternative sources of data and advances in sensor systems off er high potential in complementing information from operational products, or provide further insights into specifi c local questions. We thus briefl y touch upon the potential of such systems, including active sensing and/or airborne technologies such as Synthetic Aperture Radar, Light Detection and Ranging, use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and hyperspectral imaging, and introduce studies carried under SASSCAL using these systems.","tags":null,"title":"Remote sensing-based environmental assessment and monitoring – generation of operational baseline and enhanced experimental products in southern Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1253e1412c0ff38c1947c80bdf93dfbb","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/sattgruen/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sattgruen/","section":"project","summary":"Role: Associated","tags":["completed"],"title":"SattGrün","type":"project"},{"authors":["David Parduhn","David Frantz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"775b227190fc27612e9c526495d9cd5d","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/parduhn-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343386Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parduhn-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Zambia has been losing about 250,000 ha of forest annually.

These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming. We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5–8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994–1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailed information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics. We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing.","tags":null,"title":"Assessment of spatio-temporal changes of smallholder cultivation patterns in the Angolan Miombo belt using segmentation of Landsat time series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erik Haß","David Frantz","Sebastian Mader","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"82b1b2ffeb5af9b2f6e6bc583d4d0c4b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/hass-2017/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.342251Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hass-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Image compositing enables the generation of continuous and equidistant time series of vegetation indices (VIs) as a requisite for deriving phenological metrics. This is achieved by selecting a representative choice from available observations within a compositing period. Commonly, phenological processors associate the VI value with a reference date rather than the actual acquisition date. This letter focuses on a global assessment of the resulting temporal discrepancy between the assumed reference date and the actual acquisition date using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-VI day of composite (DOC) information from 2000 to 2015. It is shown that the long-term global mean DOC coincides with the midday of a compositing period (day 8.44 ± 0.44). The global summarized 2-D frequency distributions of succeeding compositing periods revealed that only 16.93% of all occurrences indicate a 16-day difference. The commonly used assumptions that the DOC coincides with the first, mid, or last day of the compositing period on average only hold true for 7.02%, 6.07%, and 6.03% of temporal succeeding compositing periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of 2-D frequency distributions occur as a result of climatic regions and seasonality. A MODIS tile is on average composed of more than 50% DOC combinations, indicating deviations (1-31 days) from the 16-day difference. Since information about the actual acquisition date is available, and methods for the incorporation of irregular data into phenological analysis do exist, it is recommended to incorporate this information into the phenology research based on VI time series to avoid unnecessary uncertainty.","tags":null,"title":"Global Analysis of the Differences Between the MODIS Vegetation Index Compositing Date and the Actual Acquisition Date","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"f75b96314d95a546a141c07fc06a2eee","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2017/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.340585Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The need for operational monitoring of landscape processes on the national to global scale led to an increased demand for pixel-based composites using complete earth observation (EO) archives. Commonly, composites are generated without explicit consideration of temporal criteria but are rather based on optimizing band indices within a pre-defined temporal window. However, for certain applications phenology-adapted composites that represent the land surface as being in the same phenological stage are required, e.g. tree type discrimination where greening up or senescence dates are modified by terrain elevation. We developed a novel pixel-based compositing technique that dynamically adjusts the selection process to the underlying land surface phenology (LSP) of each pixel. By doing so, phenologically sound composites across large areas can be derived for regular intervals and different phenological points in time, e.g. peak, end or minimum of season. Various day-of-year (DOY) scoring functions were implemented to flexibly define the phenological target. The technique is general enough for global application and can be applied to any kind of gridded EO archive, herein demonstrated for MODIS and Landsat data. Multi-annual composites were successfully generated for Zambia for most seasons. As an exception, we found even very frequent MODIS observations to be insufficient for peak vegetation composites due to interference with the rainy season. The phenology-adaptive composites were compared to static ones, i.e. using a single target DOY. Results clearly indicated that biomass levels differ significantly between the techniques, and a phenological normalization across elevation gradients and land cover classes could be achieved. However, the implications are non-trivial and the characteristics of both methods need to be considered cautiously before deciding which approach is superior with regards to a specific thematic application. The quality of the MODIS and Landsat composites, as well as the performance of the phenology-adaptive and static compositing techniques were assured using a quantitative cross-comparison. A 12-year annual time series demonstrated the feasibility for land cover change and modification mapping. Several change processes were clearly discriminable. The resulting phenologically coherent composites are important to establish national, regional or even global landscape monitoring, reporting and verification systems.","tags":null,"title":"Phenology-adaptive pixel-based compositing using optical earth observation imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anne Schneibel","David Frantz","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","Kim Fischer","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"bd9109db67045796cbd0f50821689198","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schneibel-2017b/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.344534Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schneibel-2017b/","section":"publication","summary":"Dry tropical forests undergo massive conversion and degradation processes. This also holds true for the extensive Miombo forests that cover large parts of Southern Africa. While the largest proportional area can be found in Angola, the country still struggles with food shortages, insufficient medical and educational supplies, as well as the ongoing reconstruction of infrastructure after 27 years of civil war. Especially in rural areas, the local population is therefore still heavily dependent on the consumption of natural resources, as well as subsistence agriculture. This leads, on one hand, to large areas of Miombo forests being converted for cultivation purposes, but on the other hand, to degradation processes due to the selective use of forest resources. While forest conversion in south-central rural Angola has already been quantitatively described, information about forest degradation is not yet available. This is due to the history of conflicts and the therewith connected research difficulties, as well as the remote location of this area. We apply an annual time series approach using Landsat data in south-central Angola not only to assess the current degradation status of the Miombo forests, but also to derive past developments reaching back to times of armed conflicts. We use the Disturbance Index based on tasseled cap transformation to exclude external influences like inter-annual variation of rainfall. Based on this time series, linear regression is calculated for forest areas unaffected by conversion, but also for the pre-conversion period of those areas that were used for cultivation purposes during the observation time. Metrics derived from linear regression are used to classify the study area according to their dominant modification processes. We compare our results to MODIS latent integral trends and to further products to derive information on underlying drivers. Around 13% of the Miombo forests are affected by degradation processes, especially along streets, in villages, and close to existing agriculture. However, areas in presumably remote and dense forest areas are also affected to a significant extent. A comparison with MODIS derived fire ignition data shows that they are most likely affected by recurring fires and less by selective timber extraction. We confirm that areas that are used for agriculture are more heavily disturbed by selective use beforehand than those that remain unaffected by conversion. The results can be substantiated by the MODIS latent integral trends and we also show that due to extent and location, the assessment of forest conversion is most likely not sufficient to provide good estimates for the loss of natural resources.","tags":null,"title":"Using Annual Landsat Time Series for the Detection of Dry Forest Degradation Processes in South-Central Angola","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill\nPrecision Forestry 2016: Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 21 December 2016, Trier, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1482278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1482278400,"objectID":"449c5089157d5e80299e55439f09472a","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb037/","publishdate":"2016-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb037/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill @ Precision Forestry 2016: Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 21 December 2016, Trier, Germany","tags":["2016"],"title":"Sentinel4GRIPS - Aufbereitung von Satellitenbildarchiven zur Charakterisierung von Waldsystemen","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill\nVeränderungserkennung mittels Fernerkundungsdaten, 8-9 November 2016, Koblenz, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1478563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478563200,"objectID":"105f8a162828193e67ea95aaa03286d7","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb038/","publishdate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb038/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Erik Haß, Joachim Hill @ Veränderungserkennung mittels Fernerkundungsdaten, 8-9 November 2016, Koblenz, Germany","tags":["2016"],"title":"Integration von Sentinel-2 Daten in die automatisierte Level-2 Prozessierung von Erdbeobachtungsdaten","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470009600,"objectID":"ba619ecb3ba8309fe3615057d618f8f2","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/sentinel4grips/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sentinel4grips/","section":"project","summary":"Role: Researcher","tags":["completed"],"title":"Sentinel4GRIPS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marion Stellmes, David Frantz, Manfred Finckh, Rasmus Revermann, Achim Röder, Vera De Cauwer, Anne Schneibel, Joachim Hill\nGEO BON 2016 Open Science Conference \u0026amp;

Cloud and cloud shadow detection is performed by a modified Fmask code. Surface reflectance is inferred from Tanré's formulation of the radiative transfer, including adjacency effect correction. A precompiled MODIS water vapor database provides daily or climatological fallback estimates. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is estimated over dark objects (DOs) that are identified in a combined database and image-based approach, where information on their temporal persistency is utilized. AOD is inferred with consideration of the actual target reflectance and background contamination effect. In case of absent DOs in bright scenes, a fallback approach with a modeled AOD climatology is used instead. Topographic normalization is performed by a modified C-correction. The data are projected into a single coordinate system and are organized in a gridded data structure for simplified pixel-based access. We based the assessment of the produced data set on an exhaustive analysis of overlapping pixels: 98.8% of the redundant overlaps are in the range of the expected ±2.5% overall radiometric algorithm accuracy. AOD is in very good agreement with Aerosol Robotic Network sunphotometer data (R 2 : 0.72 to 0.79, low intercepts, and slopes near unity). The uncertainty in using the water vapor fallback climatology is approximately ±2.8% for the TM SWIR1 band in the wet season. The topographic correction was considered successful by an investigation of the nonrelationship between the illumination angle and the corrected radiance.","tags":null,"title":"An Operational Radiometric Landsat Preprocessing Framework for Large-Area Time Series Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anne Schneibel","Marion Stellmes","Achim Röder","Manfred Finckh","Rasmus Revermann","David Frantz","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ae965d6a9d58acd19a57baf51bbf0775","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/schneibel-2016/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.345113Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schneibel-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The repopulation of abandoned areas in Angola after 27 years of civil war led to a fast and extensive expansion of agricultural fields to meet the rising food demand. Yet, the increase in crop production at the expense of natural resources carries an inherent potential for conflicts since the demand for timber and wood extraction are also supposed to rise. We use the concept of ecosystem services to evaluate the trade-off between food and woody biomass. Our study area is located in central Angola, in the highlands of the upper Okavango catchment. We used Landsat data (spatial resolution: 30 × 30 m) with a bi-temporal and multi-seasonal change detection approach for five time steps between 1989 and 2013 to estimate the conversion area from woodland to agriculture. Overall accuracy is 95%, user's accuracy varies from 89–95% and producer's accuracy ranges between 92–99%. To quantify the trade-off between woody biomass and the amount of food, this information was combined with indicator values and we furthermore assessed biomass regrowth on fallows. Our results reveal a constant rise in agricultural expansion from 1989–2013 with the mean annual deforestation rate increasing from roughly 5300 ha up to about 12,000 ha. Overall, 5.6% of the forested areas were converted to agriculture, whereas the FAO states a national deforestation rate for Angola of 5% from 1990–2010 (FAO, 2010). In the last time step 961,000 t per year of woodland were cleared to potentially produce 1240 t per year of maize. Current global agro-economical projections forecast increasing pressure on tropical dry forests from large-scale agriculture schemes (Gasparri et al., 2015; Searchinger and Heimlich, 2015). Our study underlines the importance of considering subsistence-related change processes, which may contribute significantly to negative effects associated with deforestation and degradation of these forest ecosystems.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating the Trade-Off Between Food and Timber Resulting from the Conversion of Miombo Forests to Agricultural Land in Angola Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Marion Stellmes","Achim Röder","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"24c9ba0d63dc2507ae37c47d1af38fa2","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2016e/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.341693Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2016e/","section":"publication","summary":"Fire spread information on a large scale is still a missing key layer for a complete description of fire regimes. We developed a novel multilevel object-based methodology that extracts valuable information about fire dynamics from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area data. Besides the large area capabilities, this approach also derives very detailed information for every single fire regarding timing and location of its ignition, as well as detailed directional multitemporal spread information. The approach is a top–down approach and a multilevel segmentation strategy is used to gradually refine the individual object membership. The multitemporal segmentation alternates between recursive seed point identification and queue-based fire tracking. The algorithm relies on only a few input parameters that control the segmentation with spatial and temporal distance thresholds. We present exemplary results that indicate the potential for further use of the derived parameters.","tags":null,"title":"Fire spread from MODIS burned area data: obtaining fire dynamics information for every single fire","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Achim Röder","Thomas Udelhoven","Michael Schmidt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d7c53946643c96c21997fb7bef9b1428","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2016c/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.341134Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2016c/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatio-temporal information on process-based forest loss is essential for a wide range of applications. Despite remote sensing being the only feasible means of monitoring forest change at regional or greater scales, there is no retrospectively available remote sensor that meets the demand of monitoring forests with the required spatial detail and guaranteed high temporal frequency. As an alternative, we employed the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to produce a dense synthetic time series by fusing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) adjusted reflectance. Forest loss was detected by applying a multi-temporal disturbance detection approach implementing a Disturbance Index-based detection strategy. The detection thresholds were permutated with random numbers for the normal distribution in order to generate a multi-dimensional threshold confidence area. As a result, a more robust parameterization and a spatially more coherent detection could be achieved. (i) The original Landsat time series; (ii) synthetic time series; and a (iii) combined hybrid approach were used to identify the timing and extent of disturbances. The identified clearings in the Landsat detection were verified using an annual woodland clearing dataset from Queensland’s Statewide Landcover and Trees Study. Disturbances caused by stand-replacing events were successfully identified. The increased temporal resolution of the synthetic time series indicated promising additional information on disturbance timing. The results of the hybrid detection unified the benefits of both approaches, i.e., the spatial quality and general accuracy of the Landsat detection and the increased temporal information of synthetic time series. Results indicated that a temporal improvement in the detection of the disturbance date could be achieved relative to the irregularly spaced Landsat data for sufficiently large patches.","tags":null,"title":"Forest Disturbance Mapping Using Dense Synthetic Landsat/MODIS Time-Series and Permutation-Based Disturbance Index Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Marion Stellmes","Achim Röder","Thomas Udelhoven","Sebastian Mader","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"fccfb53daefb146d1062713ad083259f","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2016b/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.34197Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2016b/","section":"publication","summary":"Satellite-derived land surface phenology (LSP) serves as a valuable input source for many environmental applications such as land cover classifications and global change studies. Commonly, LSP is derived from coarse-resolution (CR) sensors due to their well-suited temporal resolution. However, LSP is increasingly demanded at medium resolution (MR), but inferring LSP directly from MR imagery remains a challenging task (e.g., due to acquisition frequency). As such, we present a methodology that directly predicts MR LSP on the basis of the respective CR LSP and MR reflectance imagery. The approach considers information from the local pixel neighborhood at both resolutions by utilizing several prediction proxies, including spectral distance and multiscale heterogeneity metrics. The prediction performs well with simulated data (R2=0.84), and the approach substantially reduces noise. The size of the smallest reliably predicted object coincides with the effective CR pixel size (i.e., field-of-view). Nevertheless, even subpixel objects can be reliably predicted provided that pure CR pixels are located within the search radius. The application to real MODIS LSP and Landsat reflectance well preserves the phenological landscape composition, and the spatial refinement is especially striking in heterogeneous agricultural areas, where, for example, the circular shape of center pivot irrigation schemes is successfully restored at MR.","tags":null,"title":"Improving the Spatial Resolution of Land Surface Phenology by Fusing Medium- and Coarse-Resolution Inputs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rasmus Revermann","Manfred Finckh","Marion Stellmes","Ben Strohbach","David Frantz","Jens Oldeland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d170c498342536be809e96bf54033220","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/revermann-2016/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.343655Z","relpermalink":"/publication/revermann-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"In many parts of Africa, spatially-explicit information on plant α-diversity, i.e., the number of species in a given area, is missing as baseline information for spatial planning. We present an approach on how to combine vegetation-plot databases and remotely-sensed land surface phenology (LSP) metrics to predict plant α-diversity on a regional scale. We gathered data on plant α-diversity, measured as species density, from 999 vegetation plots sized 20 m × 50 m covering all major vegetation units of the Okavango basin in the countries of Angola, Namibia and Botswana. As predictor variables, we used MODIS LSP metrics averaged over 12 years (250-m spatial resolution) and three topographic attributes calculated from the SRTM digital elevation model. Furthermore, we tested whether additional climatic data could improve predictions. We tested three predictor subsets: (1) remote sensing variables; (2) climatic variables; and (3) all variables combined. We used two statistical modeling approaches, random forests and boosted regression trees, to predict vascular plant α-diversity. The resulting maps showed that the Miombo woodlands of the Angolan Central Plateau featured the highest diversity, and the lowest values were predicted for the thornbush savanna in the Okavango Delta area. Models built on the entire dataset exhibited the best performance followed by climate-only models and remote sensing-only models. However, models including climate data showed artifacts. In spite of lower model performance, models based only on LSP metrics produced the most realistic maps. Furthermore, they revealed local differences in plant diversity of the landscape mosaic that were blurred by homogenous belts as predicted by climate-based models. This study pinpoints the high potential of LSP metrics used in conjunction with biodiversity data derived from vegetation-plot databases to produce spatial information on a regional scale that is urgently needed for basic natural resource management applications.","tags":null,"title":"Linking Land Surface Phenology and Vegetation-Plot Databases to Model Terrestrial Plant α-Diversity of the Okavango Basin","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill\nPrecision Forestry - Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 18 December 2015, Trier, Germany\ninvited oral presentation\n","date":1450396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1450396800,"objectID":"795a385df521ecee3045d7514c3adbca","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb046/","publishdate":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb046/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill @ Precision Forestry - Beiträge aus Fernerkundung und Geoinformatik, 18 December 2015, Trier, Germany","tags":["2015"],"title":"Die Etablierung automatisierter Prozessierungsumgebungen zur künftigen Nutzung von Sentinel-2 Datenarchiven","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill\nGemeinsame Jahrestagung der Arbeitskreise Fernerkundung (DGfG \u0026amp; DGPF), 24-25 September 2015, Bonn, Germany  oral presentation\n","date":1443052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443052800,"objectID":"d6e5f179e20b0bb9e5096c0089e83868","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb047/","publishdate":"2015-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb047/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Marion Stellmes, Joachim Hill @ 4.

The first step consists of detecting clouds and cloud shadows in every Landsat image independently by using the Fmask algorithm. We modified two features of the original Fmask: we dropped the termination criterion for shadow matching, and we appended a darkness filter to counteract false positives in bifidly structured dryland areas. The second step utilizes the scene-by-scene detections of the first step and additional time series of cloud and cloud shadow probabilities. All clear-sky observations of a pixel are used to estimate the probabilities' median and standard deviation. Any observation that deviates more than a multiple of the standard deviation from the median is considered an outlier and thus a remaining cloud or cloud shadow. The method was specifically designed for use in water-limited dryland areas, where event-based precipitation is predominant. As an effect, green vegetation peaks are highly variable, in timing, magnitude, and frequency, with adverse effects on commonly used Fourier-based outlier detection methods. The method is designed to be robust even if temporally dense data coverage is not available.","tags":null,"title":"Enhancing the Detectability of Clouds and Their Shadows in Multitemporal Dryland Landsat Imagery: Extending Fmask","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Frantz","Achim Röder","Marion Stellmes","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"a8369f2330f4d2fe1e622ac4315f4b69","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/frantz-2015b/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.340017Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frantz-2015b/","section":"publication","summary":"We developed a spatio-temporal path reflectance climatology for use in atmospheric corrections for a Landsat pre-processing framework. The climatology is intended as a fallback strategy for aerosol estimation in bright Southern African savannah ecosystems where the rarity of dark objects decreases the applicability of common image-based aerosol estimation strategies and the widespread burning prohibits the use of a fixed aerosol loading. We predicted the climatological path reflectance surface by applying a multivariate regression model to all available path reflectance retrievals on basis of the geolocation and the days of the year on which the data were acquired. The resulting predictions are able to successfully model major spatio-temporal gradients of the path reflectance distribution. The prediction error (weighted root mean squared Error at 0.483 µm) was less than 1% reflectance while the prediction itself varied by 4.6% reflectance. Thus, using the modelled climatology for atmospheric correction is favourable compared to a fixed aerosol content.","tags":null,"title":"On the Derivation of a Spatially Distributed Aerosol Climatology for its Incorporation in a Radiometric Landsat Preprocessing Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marion Stellmes, David Frantz, Achim Röder, Torsten Weber, Joachim Hill\nGlobal Land Project (GLP) Open Science Meeting, Berlin, Germany, 19-21 March\noral presentation\n","date":1395187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1395187200,"objectID":"9d1f8b507177879e5fe7c9a91d63a9fc","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb056/","publishdate":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb056/","section":"presentation","summary":"Marion Stellmes, David Frantz, Achim Röder, Torsten  Weber, Joachim Hill @ Global Land Project (GLP) Open Science Meeting, Berlin, Germany, 19-21 March","tags":["old"],"title":"A multi-component characterization of the active Okavango Catchment and Delta based on various MODIS products","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Thomas Udelhoven, Michael Schmidt\nGlobal Land Project (GLP) Open Science Meeting, Berlin, Germany, 19-21 March\noral presentation\n","date":1395187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1395187200,"objectID":"a321452b3d22b00a862b283e5795e4ae","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/presentation/pb055/","publishdate":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/pb055/","section":"presentation","summary":"David Frantz, Achim Röder, Thomas Udelhoven, Michael Schmidt @ Global Land Project (GLP) Open Science Meeting, Berlin, Germany, 19-21 March","tags":["old"],"title":"Characterization of forest disturbance using data-blending techniques applied to MODIS and Landsat time series in an Australian Savanna","type":"presentation"},{"authors":["Miriam Machwitz","Laura Giustarini","Christian Bossung","David Frantz","Martin Schlerf","Holger Lilienthal","Loise Wandera","Patrick Matgen","Lucien Hoffmann","Thomas Udelhoven"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"93cf4996928c2856d3a929d79fc28abc","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/machwitz-2014/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.342817Z","relpermalink":"/publication/machwitz-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Complex crop growth models (CGM) require a large number of input parameters, which can cause large errors if they are uncertain. Furthermore, they often lack spatial information. The coupling of a CGM with a radiative transfer model offers the possibility to assimilate remote sensing data while taking into account uncertainties in input parameters. A particle filter was used to assimilate satellite data into a CGM coupled with a leaf-canopy radiative transfer model to update biomass simulations of maize. The synthetic experiment set up to test the reliability of the procedure, highlighted the importance of the acquisition time. The real case study with RapidEye observations confirmed these findings. Data assimilation increased the accuracy of biomass predictions in the majority of the six maize fields where biomass validation data was available, with improvements of up to 15%. The smallest and largest errors in biomass prediction after assimilation were 82 kg/ha and 2116 kg/ha, respectively. Furthermore, data assimilation enabled the production of biomass maps showing detailed spatial variability.","tags":null,"title":"Enhanced biomass prediction by assimilating satellite data into a crop growth model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1370044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1370044800,"objectID":"f325a6d86f1a4a060a49c6b28bb0493e","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/project/sasscal/","publishdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sasscal/","section":"project","summary":"Role: PhD","tags":["completed"],"title":"SASSCAL","type":"project"},{"authors":["Marion Stellmes","David Frantz","Manfred Finckh","Rasmus Revermann","Achim Röder","Joachim Hill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"84de4c2293d231cde467960e1893b10b","permalink":"https://davidfrantz.github.io/publication/stellmes-2013/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T12:44:52.345708Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stellmes-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"The analysis and evaluation of ecosystems in the Okavango region must include a thorough analysis of the fire regime. This requires a full understanding of its components such as fire frequency, fire season and fire intensity. For the Okavango region these components were derived based on an extensive multi-scale compilation of the MODIS products “Active Fire” (AF) and “Burned Area” (BA) covering the period 2001 to 2012. The integrated analysis of these mutually exclusive datasets allowed for a comprehensive characterisation of important descriptors of the large scale fire regime. The descriptive fire parameters are discussed considering dominant land cover classes. These were derived by clustering phenological metrics which were in turn derived by analysing temporally dense MODIS time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).The variation within the study area regarding the overall area affected by fire, the fire frequency as well as the fire seasonality can be explained to a high degree by land cover and local human fire management practises. Thus, Miombo woodlands are less affected by fires than other vegetation communities like for instance thornbush savannahs or grasslands in the river valleys of the upper catchment.We provide a considerable overview of spatial and temporal fire dynamics within the Okavango region. This is an important step in generating the necessary information required to feed into land use management scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Fire Frequency, Fire Seasonality and Fire Intensity within the Okavango Region Derived from MODIS Fire Products","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"M.
